    "section": "Active vs. Passive Construction",
    "text": "Active vs. Passive Construction\nReaders rely on deeply-embedded syntactic preferences. For the English language, the conventional syntax that readers expect is a sentence following a subject-verb-object order. Consequently, atypical syntax will slow a reader down, increase the amount of deciphering the brain must perform, and reduce the amount of information retained. However, even with conventional subject-verb-object order, a long and complex sentence can slow down reading and increase brain activity.\nActive construction is easier to read than passive construction. With active construction, the main actor of the sentence is the grammatical subject, followed by an action verb, then the result or object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive Construction\n\n\n\n“A decision was made by the committee to proceed.”\n\nLonger\nMore indirect\nLess clear\nLess memorable\n\nMore difficult for readers to process\nConfounds the readers expectation about sentence structure\nInverts the chronological order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Construction\n\n\n\n“The committee made a decision to proceed.”\n\nShorter\nMore efficient\nMore direct\nMore memorable\nEasier for readers to process\nReplicates the chronological order of events\nConforms to reader expectations about sentence structure\n\n\n\nThe quick litmus test for determining if your sentence is active vs. passive is to ask yourself “Who’s doing the  here?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n“Additional funding can be identified through reductions in other government spending, increased Medicare taxes and in continuous improvement of care delivery processes.”\nAsk yourself: Who’s doing the identifying here? The answer is you! The sentence is essentially saying “You can identify additional funding through ….” However, the grammatical subject of the sentence is actually “Additional funding.” So, if the answer to your litmus test question isn’t the grammatical subject of the sentence, then the sentence is passive.\nNow, consider the sentence rewritten in this way: “Congress could free up additional funding by reducing other government spending, increasing Medicare taxes and promoting continuous improvement of care delivery processes.” Who is doing the freeing up of additional funds here? Congress is, and congress is the grammatical subject; thus, this sentence is constructed actively.\n\n\n\nBe careful not to assume that a passive verb will necessarily make the sentence passive. Passive construction and passive verbs aren’t the same thing. You can have active construction with a passive verb, but you cannot have passive construction with an active verb.\nFor example:\n\n“Researchers were uncertain about the significance of these unanticipated results.”\n\nPassive verb, active sentence. (Who was uncertain?)\n\n“In the studies used, some variability was discovered in the choice and definition of fatal outcomes.”\n\nPassive verb, passive sentence. (Who is doing the discovering?)\nPassive verbs are OK, but you should make your verbs portray action whenever possible. When you use active verbs, you can avoid adding in unnecessary adverbs and prepositions, which should improve the efficiency of your writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive verbs\n\n\n\nSome commonly used passive verbs include: is, was, were, have, has, has been, and appeared"

    "text": "Stress Position\nThe stress position of any sentence is the end of the sentence. This concept is true for both written and spoken language. When we speak, as we near the end of a sentence, our voices ordinarily rise in pitch on the last few words to stress the ending more strongly than the beginning or middle. As a result, items named in the ends of sentences, paragraphs, and documents receive more stress than items at the beginnings and middles. Readers find the greatest impact in the information at the end and will subsequently retain the information the longest.\nThe order of impact is as follows: End > Beginning > Middle.\nInterestingly, good writers will put less than stellar information or results (or limitations) in the beginning or middle of a sentence or paragraph in order to minimize the impact of such information.\nTo maximize the impact of the stress position(s), you should avoid sentences that are too lengthy. Long sentences:\n\nProvide few opportunities for emphasis to spotlight important items for readers to remember/focus on\nCan cause readers to lose track of the main actor/action in the sentence and lose track of relationships between items, phrases, or clauses\nCan deprive writers of opportunities for introducing readers to new information via carefully designed sequences that place new information in the stress positions of sentences, followed by sentences that use as their subjects/topics the contents of the previous sentences’ stress\n\nFor example:\n\n“The aims of this study are therefore three fold. First, we will quantify the effect of multi-drug use on the functional status of the frail elderly; second, we will determine the relationship between multi-drug use and health of the frail elderly; and third, we will define the impact of multi-drug use on the QOL of the frail elderly.”\n\nCompare the above with this group of sentences:\n\n“Therefore, this study has three aims. First, we will quantify the effect of multi-drug use on the functional status of the frail elderly. Second, we will determine the relationship between multi-drug use and health of the frail elderly.

    "text": "Sequencing\nReaders will absorb easily even the most complex and unfamiliar information if you sequence your sentences carefully. You should always place already-introduced information at the outset of your sentences. This can be done in two ways:\n\nMake the grammatical subject in the sentence refer to item(s) in the stress position of the previous sentence. This word need not necessarily match exactly a word in the previous sentences’ stress.\nFor example:\n\n“Despite the availability of effective pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, a recent community survey found that only 16% of those with panic disorder were receiving appropriate medical management . In part, this problem is a natural consequence of the phenomenology of panic disorder and panic attacks. Panic attacks are experienced as the sudden and unexplained feeling of terror that is accompanied by severe and frightening physical symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, and heart palpitations.”\n\nVersus:\n\n“Despite the availability of effective pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, a recent community survey found that only 16% of those with panic disorder were receiving appropriate medical management. In part, this problem is a natural consequence of the phenomenology of panic disorder and panic attacks. Panic attacks are experienced as the sudden and unexplained feeling of terror that is accompanied by severe and frightening physical symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, and heart palpitations.”\n\nNotice the bolded sections. The second sentence refers back to the problem highlighted in the stress position of the first sentence. In this case, the subject of sentence #2 does not repeat verbatim the stress of sentence #1. In contrast, the third sentence uses sentence #2’s stress position as its grammatical subject.\nMake the grammatical subject refer back to the subject of the preceding sentence.\nFor example:\n\n“Although most of these screening tools have demonstrated good overall psychometric properties, they are quite variable in their ability to accurately detect panic disorder. For example, PRIME-MD, one of the most widely used psy-chiatric screening instruments, has been reported to identify 83% of general medical patients with”any” psychiatric disorder, but only 57% of those with panic disorder. Only a few screening tools have been designed specifically to detect panic.”\n\nNotice the continuity between the sentences: each sentence’s grammatical subject is closely related (or verbatim) to the previous sentence."

On the other hand, Conversely establishes a disjunction between the upcoming sentence and the previous sentence(s).\nIf you do not tell the reader how the two sentences are related, they may infer the wrong relationship – particularly if they are unfamiliar with the topic!\n\n\nTransitions should occur either before the subject and verb or between the subject and verb – not after! Once the reader hits the verb, the transition is too late to assist him/her in making projections about the content of the sentence.\nConsider the following example:\n\n“As standard practice, many clinicians are upgrading conventional pacemakers to biventricular pacemakers in patients who subsequently develop heart failure. There are little clinical data to support this practice, however.”\n\nNotice that the transition, “however,” is contained at the end of the sentence (after the verb). Including the transition in this location is pointless because the reader has already inferred the relationship between the first and second sentence by the time they reach the transition. If they correctly inferred the relationship, then reading the word is a waste of time. On the other hand, if they incorrectly inferred the relationship, the transition will throw them off be-cause it will contrast the inferred relationship, making them go back and reread the passage (wasting even more time!).\nInstead, the sentence could be written:\n\n“As standard practice, many clinicians are upgrading conventional pacemakers to biventricular pacemakers in patients who subsequently develop heart failure. However, this practice has scant clinical data to support it.”\n\nDid you catch the expletive and passive sentence in the first version?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Note on Continuity\n\n\n\nContinuity always trumps clarity. If you need to use passive construction to maintain a strong sequence between sentences, use it!"

    "text": "Paragraph Structure\nBegin paragraphs with a set of comprehensive review sentences or a paragraph head. These paragraph heads should help the reader anticipate the full scope of the paragraph that follows. The paragraph head should be approximately 1-3 sentences that introduce the reader to the context, broad topic, and finally, the main point of your paragraph. This sentence (or group of sentences) shouldn’t occupy more than 1/3 of the length of the paragraph. In other words, if you’re writing a short para-graph, you shouldn’t need more than one sentence to introduce it. The paragraph head should be as specific as possible when looking ahead. If your paragraph delivers four causes of a condition, mention that you’re going to cover four causes in the paragraph head, rather than using “several” or “numerous.” In addition, the paragraph head should be slightly discontinuous with the body of the paragraph so that readers can perceive a break between the two sections. Lastly, the paragraph head should not introduce information that is included in subsequent paragraphs.\nConsider this example:\n\nAs with the timing of functional deficits, the severity of speech, voice, and swallowing impairments can display extremely variability across patients. Small resections to oral cavity structures may result in minor speech deviations. Larger re-sections are likely to result in greater deviations. Likewise, laryngeal surgeries often result in some degree of dysphonia with the degree of vocal deficits often related to the amount of tissue removed and the success of any reconstruction. Even among patients experiencing total laryngectomy, postsurgical esophageal or artificial voice abilities may vary widely. Similar analogies are found in patients treated with radiation therapy. Greater mucosal and muscle changes result in a higher risk for more severe functional limitations. Increased severity of functional limitations is typically related to the need for an expanded rehabilitation effort. Any rehabilitation effort must consider the nature and extent of patient symptoms and the underlying contributors to those symptoms.\n\nThe paragraph body should support the statement(s) made in the paragraph head and should never introduce a shift in topic or focus. Rather, if a shift in topic/focus is needed, begin a new paragraph that has its own paragraph head.\nIn summary, all paragraphs should…\n\nContain a paragraph head (between 1 and 3 sentences) that primes the reader for what they will read in the para-graph body\nBe at least 3 sentences long\nContain a paragraph body (≥2 sentences) that supports the paragraph head"

    "text": "Manuscript Structure\nThe same organization (head & body) used in paragraphs can be applied to entire sections of a manuscript or to the entire manuscript. For example, the introduction of a manuscript functions as a head for the entire article. Thus, the first paragraph should contain a preliminary thesis to inform readers immediately of the article’s focus.\nLikewise, the final paragraph of the introduction should end with the article’s primary focus/significance. Remember stress order: the very last sentence of the last paragraph should contain the article’s thesis sentence since this sentence will be what the reader remembers most. For a review manuscript, this sentence should precisely describe the purpose of the review and the topics that will be covered. The same general principle holds true for the final summary paragraph. Ostensibly, the summary will be the last thing read and will remain in memory the longest. Consequently, this section should clearly repeat (in general terms) the main points of the review that you would like the reader to remember."

    "text": "The Cardiovascular Medications Lab (CVmedLab) at the University of Florida investigates real world safety and effectiveness of cardiovascular medications. We ask questions like how are cardiovascular diseases treated in the real world and how do these treatment regimens evolve over time? Are certain medications more effective than others for a particular cardiovascular disease? To what extent are well-known disparities in cardiovascular disease outcomes explained by differences in treatment approaches? These kinds of questions are investigated using observational data (e.g., electronic health records, insurance claims data) and epidemiologic methods , as well as with prospective clinical trials. The CVmedLab uses a variety of computational methods and tools to conduct and communicate research.\nCurrent and previous lab members include graduate students pursuing master’s or doctoral degrees, postdoctoral researcher associates, and Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) students. If you are interested in cardiovascular disease treatment and using computational techniques for designing and executing studies, analyzing data, and developing new technologies, then you may be interested in joining the team.\nThe lab is located in the Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy in the College of Pharmacy at UF, and affiliated with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety and the Center for Integrative Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease."
