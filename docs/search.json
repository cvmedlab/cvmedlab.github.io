The following describes one way of automating much of this, using R and the table1() function in the table1 package."

If you want to read more, see it’s vignette at the aforementioned link.\n\n\nHaven\nHaven is a tidyverse package that reads SAS datasets directly. Particularly helpful for us since most of our initial data wrangling has to take place in SAS. If you haven’t noticed already, base R is not particularly good at handling huge datasets (absent a lot of memory resources on a VM) because it completely stores them in memory.\n\n\nFlextable\nFlextable will be used to get the final output into a word document. Will explain more on this later.\n\n# if you need to install, you would use:\n# install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"table1\"))\n\n# load the relevant packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(table1)\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(flextable)"

First, you assign the object tab1 (can be any name you want it to be) something using the <- assignment operator, and you assign it the dataset returned by the read_sas() function from haven. There’s lots more options with this function than I use below, but the basics usually work well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that R has case-sensitive variable/column names. Make your life a lot easier and rename variables to lowercase with the rename_with() function and tolower option, i.e., rename_with(tolower) (see below)\n\n\n\n# note that the filepath needs forward slashes, or two backwards slashes,\n# e.g., \"C:/Users/.../...sas7bdat\" or \"C:\\\\Users\\\\...\\\\...sas7bdat\"\n#\n# tab1 <- read_sas(\"E:/.../.../...sas7bdat\") %>% \n#   rename_with(tolower)"

See this here or here. It’s a tidyverse thing originally coming from the magrittr package.

You can use ctrl+shift+M as a short-cut, and in your R-studio preferences, you can tell R-Studio whether to use the native pipe |> or magrittr’s %>%.

I think a modification can probably be built into the package to do this routinely, or as an option, but I haven’t had time to fool with it. In any event, this gets us pretty close."

    "text": "Getting this into Word\nOk, we have the table in HTML now, but we need it in Word. A straight copy + paste from R Studio viewer to word document does not work very well, because it either keeps all the HTML formatting (check by selecting all of the pasted table and adding all borders to the table), or it completely loses formatting if you do a Special Paste, i.e., no Word table structure any more.\nHere’s a couple of ways around this (I’m sure there are others):\n\nExport the output in the R Studio viewer to an HTML file on your computer. Then, open that file, hit CTRL+A (or CMD+A on Mac), CTRL + C, then go to Word Document and Paste Special -> HTML. It typically doesn’t look as pretty, but fixes both of the above issues.\nLet Flextable do the heavy lifting for this.\n\nHere, I use flextable. Instead of printing the table1() function results, as above, we can instead save them to an object, named tbl1 below. Then, convert it to a flextable, and have the flextable package export it as a word document.\n\n# same as above, but instead of printing, saving as object. \ntbl1 <- table1(strata_t1, \n               labels_t1, \n               droplevels = TRUE, \n               # these next three lines are just applying the functions we created above\n               # basically can be read as \"for rendering continuous variables, use the \n               # function render.continuous()\", etc. \n               render.continuous = render.continuous, \n               render.strat = render.strat, \n               render.categorical = render.categorical)\n\n# convert to flextable, then save as doc.\n# update path as needed. \nt1flex(tbl1) %>% \n  save_as_docx(path=\"./output/table1_output.docx\")\n\nVoila - here’s the output."

    "text": "We often do stratified analyses, in which we wish to show hazard ratios, or odds ratios, and their confidence intervals graphically, stratified across levels of a variable. For example, we might be interested in whether Drug A is better than Drug B at preventing some outcome, and whether the magnitude of that effect differs across sexes, race groups, or patients who have/do not have some comorbidity.\nThis labdoc focuses on creating the figure to display such analyses. We’ll discuss running the analyses that underly such a figure elsewhere (to come). There are several packages that can create forest plots, but this one – forestploter – is pretty easy/straightforward and customizable.\nFirst, let’s load the relevant libraries and create some data.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)      # for data wrangling\nlibrary(forestploter)   # for the forest plot\nlibrary(knitr)          # for kable() to print a nice table\nlibrary(grid)           # grid and gridExtra to glue a couple plots together\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n# some summary data calculated elsewhere\nmace <- tribble(\n  ~Subgroup, ~est, ~low.ci, ~high.ci, ~p.interaction,\n#  Subgroup, point estimate, low end of 95% CI, high end of 95% CI, p-value for interaction\n  \"History of ESA use\", NA, NA, NA, 0.745,\n  \"No\", 1.00, 0.86, 1.16, NA,\n  \"Yes\", 0.97, 0.92, 1.02, NA,\n  \"Race\", NA, NA, NA, 0.203,\n  \"White\", 1.01, 0.95, 1.07, NA,\n  \"Black\", 0.89, 0.80, 0.99, NA,\n  \"Others\", 0.99, 0.79, 1.23, NA,\n  \"Age group\", NA, NA, NA, 0.244,\n  \"18 to 64 y\", 0.93, 0.85, 1.02, NA,\n  \"65 and above\", 0.99, 0.91, 1.05, NA,\n  \"Sex\", NA, NA, NA, 0.664,\n  \"Female\", 0.96, 0.89, 1.04, NA,\n  \"Male\", 0.98, 0.92, 1.06, NA\n  )\n\n# print the table\nkable(mace)\n\n\n\n\nSubgroup\nest\nlow.ci\nhigh.ci\np.interaction\n\n\n\n\nHistory of ESA use\nNA\nNA\nNA\n0.745\n\n\nNo\n1.00\n0.86\n1.16\nNA\n\n\nYes\n0.97\n0.92\n1.02\nNA\n\n\nRace\nNA\nNA\nNA\n0.203\n\n\nWhite\n1.01\n0.95\n1.07\nNA\n\n\nBlack\n0.89\n0.80\n0.99\nNA\n\n\nOthers\n0.99\n0.79\n1.23\nNA\n\n\nAge group\nNA\nNA\nNA\n0.244\n\n\n18 to 64 y\n0.93\n0.85\n1.02\nNA\n\n\n65 and above\n0.99\n0.91\n1.05\nNA\n\n\nSex\nNA\nNA\nNA\n0.664\n\n\nFemale\n0.96\n0.89\n1.04\nNA\n\n\nMale\n0.98\n0.92\n1.06\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above table is the summary data from the stratified analyses. Stratification variables are supplied as their own line, with several NA values and, finally, the p-value for the interaction test. The levels of the stratification variable have more information, including the value of the level, the point estimate, and the lower and upper confidence intervals.\nNext, we will do a few data edits to prepare for the forest plot.\n\nmace <- mace |> \n  mutate(# indent levels of the strata (subgroup), but not the name of the strata\n         Subgroup = if_else(is.na(est), Subgroup, paste0(\"    \", Subgroup)),\n         \n         # create a standard error value to size the box of the forest plot\n         se = (log(high.ci) - log(est))/1.96,\n         \n         # create a space for the actual plot - you may need to adjust the # (30) here \n         ` ` = paste(rep(\" \", 30), collapse = \" \"),\n         \n         # glue together a HR (95% CI) for display\n         `HR (95% CI)` = if_else(is.na(se), \"\", sprintf(\"%.2f (%.2f - %.2f)\", est, low.ci, high.ci)),\n         \n         # rename p-interaction, and convert to string (may also want to use sprintf() function if needed)\n         `p-interaction` = if_else(is.na(p.interaction), \"\", paste(p.interaction))) |> \n  \n  # get rid of the old p.interaction variable, as we no longer need it. \n  select(-p.interaction)\n\nkable(mace)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubgroup\nest\nlow.ci\nhigh.ci\nse\n\nHR (95% CI)\np-interaction\n\n\n\n\nHistory of ESA use\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n0.745\n\n\nNo\n1.00\n0.86\n1.16\n0.0757245\n\n1.00 (0.86 - 1.16)\n\n\n\nYes\n0.97\n0.92\n1.02\n0.0256438\n\n0.97 (0.92 - 1.02)\n\n\n\nRace\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n0.203\n\n\nWhite\n1.01\n0.95\n1.07\n0.0294430\n\n1.01 (0.95 - 1.07)\n\n\n\nBlack\n0.89\n0.80\n0.99\n0.0543283\n\n0.89 (0.80 - 0.99)\n\n\n\nOthers\n0.99\n0.79\n1.23\n0.1107472\n\n0.99 (0.79 - 1.23)\n\n\n\nAge group\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n0.244\n\n\n18 to 64 y\n0.93\n0.85\n1.02\n0.0471292\n\n0.93 (0.85 - 1.02)\n\n\n\n65 and above\n0.99\n0.91\n1.05\n0.0300207\n\n0.99 (0.91 - 1.05)\n\n\n\nSex\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n0.664\n\n\nFemale\n0.96\n0.89\n1.04\n0.0408381\n\n0.96 (0.89 - 1.04)\n\n\n\nMale\n0.98\n0.92\n1.06\n0.0400365\n\n0.98 (0.92 - 1.06)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see by comparing this table to the first one above, the code above just cleans up the data a bit and gets it ready for display. One thing that’s not obvious from the output table is that the levels within each strata (for example, Male and Female) are indented. If you opened the table with View(mace) you would see this:\n\nThis indentation is necessary if you want the eventual forest plot to have the same indentation for each level of a strata. If you don’t care (or don’t even want strata headers), you could omit the step that creates this indentation.\nYou may need to adjust the above code to get your forest plot just right. One thing to note: the variable names will be the headers in the figure. So if you want something, for example, that includes spaces, you need to name the variable with `’s around it (see, for example, the HR (95% CI) variable I created above).\nNext, we create the theme. There’s lots of options here. Run ??forestploter::forest_theme in your Console to see the options.\n\ntm <- forest_theme(base_size = 10,\n                   refline_col = \"black\",\n                   arrow_type = \"closed\")\n\nAnd, finally, we create the plot and plot it. Note that the first line, forest(mace[,c(1, 6:8)]) selects the specific columns (1, 6, 7, and 8) we’re going to include. ci_column specifies where to put the actual forest plot, numbered as columns from the first (left-most).\n\np <- forest(mace[,c(1, 6:8)],\n            est = mace$est,\n            lower = mace$low.ci, \n            upper = mace$high.ci,\n            sizes = mace$se,\n            ci_column = 2,\n            ref_line = 1,\n            x_trans = \"log\",\n            arrow_lab = c(\"Short-acting Better\", \"Long-acting Better\"),\n            xlim = c(0.75, 1.3),\n            ticks_at = c(0.75, 1, 1.25),\n            theme = tm,\n            title = \"A. Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events\") \n\n# Print plot\nplot(p)\n\n\n\n\nWe could easily add a second plot and glue them together with gridExtra::grid.arrange().\n\ndeath <- tribble(\n  ~Subgroup, ~est, ~low.ci, ~high.ci, ~p.interaction,\n  \"History of ESA use\", NA, NA, NA, 0.745,\n  \"No\", 1.00, 0.86, 1.16, NA,\n  \"Yes\", 0.97, 0.92, 1.02, NA,\n  \"Race\", NA, NA, NA, 0.203,\n  \"White\", 1.01, 0.95, 1.07, NA,\n  \"Black\", 0.89, 0.80, 0.99, NA,\n  \"Others\", 0.99, 0.79, 1.23, NA,\n  \"Age group\", NA, NA, NA, 0.244,\n  \"18 to 64 y\", 0.93, 0.85, 1.02, NA,\n  \"65 and above\", 0.99, 0.91, 1.05, NA,\n  \"Sex\", NA, NA, NA, 0.664,\n  \"Female\", 0.96, 0.89, 1.04, NA,\n  \"Male\", 0.98, 0.92, 1.06, NA\n  ) |> \n  mutate(Subgroup = if_else(is.na(est), Subgroup, paste0(\"    \", Subgroup)),\n         se = (log(high.ci) - log(est))/1.96,\n         ` ` = paste(rep(\" \", 30), collapse = \" \"),\n         `HR (95% CI)` = if_else(is.na(se), \"\", sprintf(\"%.2f (%.2f - %.2f)\", est, low.ci, high.ci)),\n         `p-interaction` = if_else(is.na(p.interaction), \"\", paste(p.interaction)))\n\np2 <- forest(death[,c(1, 7:9)],\n            est = death$est,\n            lower = death$low.ci, \n            upper = death$high.ci,\n            sizes = death$se,\n            ci_column = 2,\n            ref_line = 1,\n            x_trans = \"log\", \n            arrow_lab = c(\"Short-acting Better\", \"Long-acting Better\"),\n            xlim = c(0.75, 1.3),\n            ticks_at = c(0.75, 1, 1.25),\n            theme = tm,\n            title = \"B. All-cause Death\") \n\nNow, patch them together.\n\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(p, p2, ncol=1, nrow=2)\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to save the file, you can use the base R approach, by plotting the above, getting it to look just how you want it by adjusting spacing, or other options, then running dev.copy() and dev.off(). Another option is to arrange them in a grob, which you can then save w/ ggsave().\n\n# base R approach, once the panel (or individual plot) has been plotted in your Viewer\n# Note this would saving as svg, but you could instead use other options: pdf, png, jpg, etc..\ndev.copy(svg, \"path_to_location/filename.svg\")\ndev.off()\n\n# grob approach\ng <- arrangeGrob(p, p2, nrow=2) \n\nggsave(file = \"path_to_location/filename.svg\",\n       g,\n       device = \"svg\",\n       width = 7,\n       height = 8.5,\n       units = \"in\")"

If you want to read more, see it’s vignette at the above link. {gtsummary} is based on R Studio’s {gt} package which is quite a nice package and has some other really cool extensions (e.g., {gtExtras})\n\n\n{haven}\n{haven} is a tidyverse package that reads SAS datasets directly. Particularly helpful for us since most of our initial data wrangling has to take place in SAS. If you haven’t noticed already, base R is not particularly good at handling huge datasets (absent a lot of memory resources on a VM) because it completely stores them in memory. If you really want to try though, {arrow} may be your best bet.\n\n\n{labelled}\n{labelled} allows us to apply a label to each variable as an “attribute.” Gtsummary will use these labels in the table output instead of variable/column names.\n\n\n{flextable}\n{flextable} will be used to get the final output into a word document.\nLet’s load the packages (you’ll probably get a lot of red text warning you about ‘masked’ objects – don’t sweat them).\n\n# if you need to install, you would use:\n# install.packages(\"gtsummary\")\n# or\n# install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"gtsummary\"))\n\n# load the relevant packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gtsummary)\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(labelled)\nlibrary(flextable)"

    "text": "Load the data\nHere’s where you load the SAS dataset, using the haven package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome very basic R coding format.\n\n\n\nAt the most basic level, R expects you to assign values to objects. The object can be thought of as a symbol (or name) allowing you to access the value inside. The value can be any number of things, including a vector of length one, a list, a data frame (a dataset that is a special type of list), a function, and other things. The basic formatting is object &lt;- value , which tells R to assign to ‘object’ the ‘value’ using the &lt;- assignment operator (you can also use an = for the assignment operator instead). The short-cut for the assignment operator on a Mac is Option+- (option and minus sign).\n\n\nWe are going to assign a dataset, read from haven, to the object tab1 (can be any name you want it to be). To do so, we need the read_sas() function from haven, and the thing that is returned from that function is an R-readable data frame. There’s lots more options with this function than I use below, but the basics usually work well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that R has case-sensitive variable/column names. Make your life a lot easier and rename variables to lowercase with the rename_with() function and tolower option, i.e., rename_with(tolower) (see below)\n\n\n\n# note that the filepath needs forward slashes, or two backwards slashes,\n# e.g., \"C:/Users/.../...sas7bdat\" or \"C:\\\\Users\\\\...\\\\...sas7bdat\"\n#\n# tab1 &lt;- read_sas(\"E:/.../.../...sas7bdat\") %&gt;% \n#   rename_with(tolower)"

See this here or here. It’s a tidyverse thing originally coming from the magrittr package. Because it’s quite popular, Base R has now incorporated its own pipe now which does almost exactly the same thing, but looks like this: |&gt;. You can use ctrl+shift+M as a short-cut, and in your R-studio preferences, you can tell R-Studio whether to use the native pipe |&gt; or magrittr’s %&gt;%. Basically, it’s a way to pipe an object forward from one function to the next, as opposed to having to nest a bunch of functions within one another.\n\n\nOk, here’s the data wrangling code:\n\n# generally bad practice unless you know exactly what you're doing - you don't want to write\n# over your objects, which is what I'm doing here:  writing over tab1 with a modified tab1\ntab1 &lt;- tab1 %&gt;%\n  \n  # select only variables needed; ends_with() function is a nifty short cut to \n  # grab all variables whose name ends with that string\n  select(c(\"patid\",\"source\",\"age\",\"age_cat\", \"hispanic\",\"sex\",\"race\",\"index_year\", \n           ends_with(\"indicator\"), \"combined_score_num\")) %&gt;%\n  \n  # mutate() is for creating new variables. Some of this should look pretty \n  # similar to what you're used to in SAS. \n  # c() function just combines multiple things and works similarly here to a\n  # SAS parenthetical list, i.e., race in (\"No Information\", ...)\n  mutate(race = if_else(race %in% c(\"No Information\",\"Refuse to Answer\",\"Unknown\"), \"Unknown\", race),\n         sex = if_else(sex == \"Unknow\", \"Unknown\", sex),\n         hispanic = if_else(hispanic %in% c(\"Other\",\"Refuse to Answer\", \"No Information\", \"Unknown\"), \"Unknown\", hispanic),\n         \n         # The vector type is important for what is passed on to gtsummary, because\n         # the gtsummary packages does differet things with different vector types.\n         # for example, a numeric vector gets characterized by measures of central\n         # tendency, i.e., median (IQR), or mean ± SD. A factor will get processed\n         # as a categorical variable. BUT, if you want {gtsummary} to not bother with\n         # giving you the N (%) of people without a comorbidity (e.g., CKDindicator = 0)\n         # then you want to set those as INTEGERS. \n         # Below, we set demographics as factors, because we want all levels output. \n         # But, we set the comorbidities as integers, because we only want to know the \n         # n (%) of those who have indicator=1. \n         #\n         # The following tidyverse/dplyr syntax accomplishes this quickly, by \n         # gathering all the variables we want as factors, and all the variables\n         # we want as integers, and applying the relevant function in purrr style \n         # ~lambda:\n         across(c(hispanic, sex, index_year), ~factor(.)),\n         across(ends_with(\"indicator\"), ~as.integer(.))\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # arrange() sorts (here, by patid).\n  arrange(patid) %&gt;%\n  # distinct() picks out distinct values, here of patid.\n  distinct(patid, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\n\n# here we go in and work on specific columns of `tab1` dataset and \n# order the levels (values) of that column in the way we want it presented in\n# the output table, using the factor() function.

For the English language, the conventional syntax that readers expect is a sentence following a subject-verb-object order. Consequently, atypical syntax will slow a reader down, increase the amount of deciphering the brain must perform, and reduce the amount of information retained. However, even with conventional subject-verb-object order, a long and complex sentence can slow down reading and increase brain activity.\nActive construction is easier to read than passive construction. With active construction, the main actor of the sentence is the grammatical subject, followed by an action verb, then the result or object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive Construction\n\n\n\n“A decision was made by the committee to proceed.”\n\nLonger\nMore indirect\nLess clear\nLess memorable\n\nMore difficult for readers to process\nConfounds the readers expectation about sentence structure\nInverts the chronological order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Construction\n\n\n\n“The committee made a decision to proceed.”\n\nShorter\nMore efficient\nMore direct\nMore memorable\nEasier for readers to process\nReplicates the chronological order of events\nConforms to reader expectations about sentence structure\n\n\n\nThe quick litmus test for determining if your sentence is active vs. passive is to ask yourself “Who’s doing the  here?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n“Additional funding can be identified through reductions in other government spending, increased Medicare taxes and in continuous improvement of care delivery processes.”\nAsk yourself: Who’s doing the identifying here? The answer is you! The sentence is essentially saying “You can identify additional funding through ….” However, the grammatical subject of the sentence is actually “Additional funding.” So, if the answer to your litmus test question isn’t the grammatical subject of the sentence, then the sentence is passive.\nNow, consider the sentence rewritten in this way: “Congress could free up additional funding by reducing other government spending, increasing Medicare taxes and promoting continuous improvement of care delivery processes.” Who is doing the freeing up of additional funds here? Congress is, and congress is the grammatical subject; thus, this sentence is constructed actively.\n\n\n\nBe careful not to assume that a passive verb will necessarily make the sentence passive. Passive construction and passive verbs aren’t the same thing. You can have active construction with a passive verb, but you cannot have passive construction with an active verb.\nFor example:\n\n“Researchers were uncertain about the significance of these unanticipated results.”\n\nPassive verb, active sentence. (Who was uncertain?)\n\n“In the studies used, some variability was discovered in the choice and definition of fatal outcomes.”\n\nPassive verb, passive sentence. (Who is doing the discovering?)\nPassive verbs are OK, but you should make your verbs portray action whenever possible. When you use active verbs, you can avoid adding in unnecessary adverbs and prepositions, which should improve the efficiency of your writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive verbs\n\n\n\nSome commonly used passive verbs include: is, was, were, have, has, has been, and appeared"

When we speak, as we near the end of a sentence, our voices ordinarily rise in pitch on the last few words to stress the ending more strongly than the beginning or middle. As a result, items named in the ends of sentences, paragraphs, and documents receive more stress than items at the beginnings and middles. Readers find the greatest impact in the information at the end and will subsequently retain the information the longest.\nThe order of impact is as follows: End > Beginning > Middle.\nInterestingly, good writers will put less than stellar information or results (or limitations) in the beginning or middle of a sentence or paragraph in order to minimize the impact of such information.\nTo maximize the impact of the stress position(s), you should avoid sentences that are too lengthy. Long sentences:\n\nProvide few opportunities for emphasis to spotlight important items for readers to remember/focus on\nCan cause readers to lose track of the main actor/action in the sentence and lose track of relationships between items, phrases, or clauses\nCan deprive writers of opportunities for introducing readers to new information via carefully designed sequences that place new information in the stress positions of sentences, followed by sentences that use as their subjects/topics the contents of the previous sentences’ stress\n\nFor example:\n\n“The aims of this study are therefore three fold. First, we will quantify the effect of multi-drug use on the functional status of the frail elderly; second, we will determine the relationship between multi-drug use and health of the frail elderly; and third, we will define the impact of multi-drug use on the QOL of the frail elderly.”\n\nCompare the above with this group of sentences:\n\n“Therefore, this study has three aims.

This word need not necessarily match exactly a word in the previous sentences’ stress.\nFor example:\n\n“Despite the availability of effective pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, a recent community survey found that only 16% of those with panic disorder were receiving appropriate medical management . In part, this problem is a natural consequence of the phenomenology of panic disorder and panic attacks. Panic attacks are experienced as the sudden and unexplained feeling of terror that is accompanied by severe and frightening physical symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, and heart palpitations.”\n\nVersus:\n\n“Despite the availability of effective pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, a recent community survey found that only 16% of those with panic disorder were receiving appropriate medical management.

Panic attacks are experienced as the sudden and unexplained feeling of terror that is accompanied by severe and frightening physical symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, and heart palpitations.”\n\nNotice the bolded sections. The second sentence refers back to the problem highlighted in the stress position of the first sentence. In this case, the subject of sentence #2 does not repeat verbatim the stress of sentence #1. In contrast, the third sentence uses sentence #2’s stress position as its grammatical subject.\nMake the grammatical subject refer back to the subject of the preceding sentence.\nFor example:\n\n“Although most of these screening tools have demonstrated good overall psychometric properties, they are quite variable in their ability to accurately detect panic disorder. For example, PRIME-MD, one of the most widely used psy-chiatric screening instruments, has been reported to identify 83% of general medical patients with”any” psychiatric disorder, but only 57% of those with panic disorder. Only a few screening tools have been designed specifically to detect panic.”\n\nNotice the continuity between the sentences: each sentence’s grammatical subject is closely related (or verbatim) to the previous sentence."

There are little clinical data to support this practice, however.”\n\nNotice that the transition, “however,” is contained at the end of the sentence (after the verb). Including the transition in this location is pointless because the reader has already inferred the relationship between the first and second sentence by the time they reach the transition. If they correctly inferred the relationship, then reading the word is a waste of time. On the other hand, if they incorrectly inferred the relationship, the transition will throw them off be-cause it will contrast the inferred relationship, making them go back and reread the passage (wasting even more time!).\nInstead, the sentence could be written:\n\n“As standard practice, many clinicians are upgrading conventional pacemakers to biventricular pacemakers in patients who subsequently develop heart failure. However, this practice has scant clinical data to support it.”\n\nDid you catch the expletive and passive sentence in the first version?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Note on Continuity\n\n\n\nContinuity always trumps clarity.

These paragraph heads should help the reader anticipate the full scope of the paragraph that follows. The paragraph head should be approximately 1-3 sentences that introduce the reader to the context, broad topic, and finally, the main point of your paragraph. This sentence (or group of sentences) shouldn’t occupy more than 1/3 of the length of the paragraph. In other words, if you’re writing a short para-graph, you shouldn’t need more than one sentence to introduce it. The paragraph head should be as specific as possible when looking ahead. If your paragraph delivers four causes of a condition, mention that you’re going to cover four causes in the paragraph head, rather than using “several” or “numerous.” In addition, the paragraph head should be slightly discontinuous with the body of the paragraph so that readers can perceive a break between the two sections. Lastly, the paragraph head should not introduce information that is included in subsequent paragraphs.\nConsider this example:\n\nAs with the timing of functional deficits, the severity of speech, voice, and swallowing impairments can display extremely variability across patients. Small resections to oral cavity structures may result in minor speech deviations. Larger re-sections are likely to result in greater deviations. Likewise, laryngeal surgeries often result in some degree of dysphonia with the degree of vocal deficits often related to the amount of tissue removed and the success of any reconstruction. Even among patients experiencing total laryngectomy, postsurgical esophageal or artificial voice abilities may vary widely. Similar analogies are found in patients treated with radiation therapy. Greater mucosal and muscle changes result in a higher risk for more severe functional limitations. Increased severity of functional limitations is typically related to the need for an expanded rehabilitation effort. Any rehabilitation effort must consider the nature and extent of patient symptoms and the underlying contributors to those symptoms.\n\nThe paragraph body should support the statement(s) made in the paragraph head and should never introduce a shift in topic or focus.

For any given (approved) antihypertensive drug, the dose-response curve for efficacy is to the left of the dose-response curve for toxicity (Figure 1). The difference between these curves is the therapeutic window. Relatively modest dose increases (e.g., doubling of the dose) towards the lower end of the therapeutic window can increase blood pressure response (Figure 1, point A to A′), with little impact on toxicity response (Figure 1, point AT to AT′). At the higher end of the therapeutic window, doubling of the dose leads to almost no additional blood pressure response (Figure 1, point B to B′), whereas toxicity response increases more substantially (Figure 1, point BT to BT′) (Law et al. 2003).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Dose-response relationship for efficacy and toxicity for a hypothetical antihypertensive drug.\n\n\nHowever, an important caveat with antihypertensive agents is that additional gains in BP lowering by doubling the dose, even at the low end of the efficacy dose-response curve, are relatively modest, perhaps a few mmHg on average. As can be seen in Figure 2 (left panel), the relationship between dose (as a proportion of the standard dose) and additional BP reduction achieved is remarkably similar across the major antihypertensive classes. To double the BP response with any of these classes, a dose may need to be increased 4- to 8-fold. Conversely, the relationship between dose and adverse event rates differs more markedly across classes (Figure 2, right panel), reflecting differences in therapeutic windows (Law et al. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Relationship between dose and BP response\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Relationship between dose and AE response\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between dose (as a proportion of standard recommended dose) and blood pressure response (left panel) or prevalence of adverse events (right panel).

Adapted from (Law et al. 2003).\n\n\nPatient-specific factors (e.g., pathophysiologic mechanisms causing hypertension, genetics, dietary factors, concomitant medications) can markedly affect the dose-response relationship, and these factors can differentially impact drugs or classes. For example, individuals whose hypertension is driven primarily by high RAS activity are likely to exhibit an enhanced dose-response curve to an ACE inhibitor or ARB, compared with an individual in a low-renin/high-volume state, who is likely to exhibit a flattened dose-response curve, or occasionally, no response or a pressor response, to the same drugs (Sinha and Agarwal 2019)."

Taking the example above, in a population, a significant portion of patients exhibit high-renin/low-volume hypertension, and who are more likely to have greater BP response to an ACE inhibitor or ARB, whereas those in the population with low-renin/high-volume hypertension are more notable to have a suppressed response. In the same population, the former group would have been more likely to have a suppressed BP response to diuretics, whereas the latter group would have an enhanced response. The net effect is wide variation in the dose-response relationship for both ACE inhibitors/ARBs and diuretics in the overall population (Figure 3). Combination therapy with these two classes in the same population shifts the dose-response relationship up (greater efficacy) and to the left (greater potency) and narrows the population-level variation. This occurs because each individual patient in the population is likely to have a significant response to at least one of these classes with complementary mechanisms of action. For this reason, combination therapy is often recommended over dose escalations to improve BP response at lower risk of toxicity (Sinha and Agarwal 2019).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Alterations to the dose-response curve comparing monotherapy (left) versus combination therapy, e.g., an ACE inhibitor + diuretic, with complementary mechanisms of action (right).

Baroreceptor reflexes mediate activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin angiotensin system which can promote increased cardiac output, increased peripheral vascular resistance (i.e., peripheral vasoconstriction), or sodium and water retention. These are common occurrences with some of the lesser-used antihypertensive classes (e.g., vasodilators), although more modest compensatory effects can occur with several of the first-line classes as well (Table 1). These effects can lead to pseudotolerance, where the drug remains effective at its site of action, but the net antihypertensive effect is gradually diminished due to compensatory mechanisms. Fortunately, many of these counterregulatory mechanisms can be mitigated by using rational combinations (e.g., diuretics + RAS inhibitors) or stepped therapy (e.g., diuretic, then RAS inhibitor).\n\n\nTable 1: Compensatory responses to selected antihypertensive therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass\nBP Compensatory Mechanism\n\n\n\n\n$\\alpha$1-antagonists\nSalt/water retention; tachycardia\n\n\n$\\alpha$2-agonists\nSalt/water retention\n\n\nCalcium channel blockers (esp. short-acting)\nTachycardia\n\n\nDirect vasodilators (hydralazine, minoxidil)\nSalt/water retention; tachycardia\n\n\nDiuretics\nSalt/water retention"

    "section": "Thiazide Diuretics",
    "text": "Thiazide Diuretics\nThiazide diuretics are secreted into the renal tubule. Their primary site of action is on the luminal side of the early distal convoluted tubule (DCT), where they inhibit the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporters to reduce sodium and chloride reabsorption. The enhanced urinary excretion of sodium, in turn, leads to extracellular fluid reduction and a consequent decrease in cardiac preload and output, and lowering of blood pressure. However, the duration of this effect is relatively short, lasting approximately 4 weeks. Thereafter, compensatory mechanisms, including activation of the renin angiotensin system, typically prompt a return of plasma volume to pre-treatment levels and induce transient increases in peripheral vascular resistance. Nevertheless, blood pressure typically remains suppressed with long-term use (Ernst and Fravel 2022).\nThe exact mechanism for long-term blood pressure effects with thiazides is unknown but is believed to be related to decreased peripheral vascular resistance, likely as a result of the negative sodium balance induced by all thiazides. Additional mechanisms may play a role for individual thiazides.7 For example, hydrochlorothiazide may hyperpolarize vascular smooth muscle and reduce vasoconstriction, leading to reduced peripheral vascular resistance over time. Conversely, chlorthalidone has comparatively more carbonic anhydrase activity than hydrochlorothiazide, although the extent to which this contributes to long-term blood pressure reductions is unknown (Ernst and Moser 2009).\nThiazide diuretics have noteworthy differences in pharmacokinetic properties (Table 2). Thiazides are extensively protein-bound and some (e.g., chlorthalidone, metolazone) also distribute into erythrocytes. A consequence of this high protein binding is that thiazides must be actively secreted by organic anion transporters in the proximal tubule to reach the luminal side and eventually be carried to their site of action; glomerular filtration of thiazides is generally inconsequential. Nevertheless, tubular transport capacity is an important determinant of adequate drug concentration at the site of action. Transport capacity is generally correlated with glomerular filtration rates (GFR); thus, low GFR generally indicates reduced transport capacity. Furthermore, the DCT is responsible for only a minority of sodium reabsorption. As GFR is reduced, filtered sodium is reduced, and absolute rates of sodium reabsorption in the DCT are diminished. In the absence of significant sodium reabsorption in the DCT, the natriuretic effect of thiazides is decreased. Accordingly, many clinicians consider thiazide efficacy to wane below a GFR of approximately 20-30 mL/min, although data supporting this cutoff are relatively sparse and thiazides maintain some efficacy even in severe renal impairment. The one exception is metolazone, which maintains its efficacy in more severe renal impairment, but its use is limited by slow, erratic absorption (Ellison 2019)\n\n\nTable 2: Pharmacokinetic properties of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiuretic\nBioavailability\nDistribution Volume (L/kg)\nProtein Binding\nRoute\nt1/2 (Normal)\nt1/2 (CKD)\n\n\n\n\nThiazide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Hydrochlorothiazide\n60% - 70%\n2.5\n40%\n95% renal\n9-10 hrs\nProlonged\n\n\n   Chlorothiazide\n15% - 30%\n1\n70%\n100% renal\n1.5 hrs\nProlonged\n\n\n   Bendroflumethiazide\n>90%\n1-1.5\n94%\n30% renal\n9 hrs\nProlonged\n\n\nThiazide-like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Chlorthalidone\n65%\n3-13\n99%\n65% renal\n50-60 hrs\nProlonged\n\n\n   Indapamide\n90%\n25-60 (total)\n75%\nHepatic\n14 hrs\nProlonged\n\n\n   Metolazone\n65%\n113 (total)\n95%\n80% renal\n8-14 hrs\nProlonged\n\n\n\n\nOnset of natriuretic action begins, on average, in 1-2 hours and dissipates by 6 hours for most thiazides. However antihypertensive duration of action persists beyond the natriuretic effects and is variable across agents. Most of the commonly-used thiazides have a duration of action of at least 12 hours, allowing for once-daily administration with most agents, though hydrochlorothiazide may require twice-daily dosing to achieve optimal blood pressure lowering and maintain such effects throughout the 24-hour dosing period. Chlorthalidone is somewhat unique among the thiazides owing to its binding to carbonic anhydrase and heavy partitioning into erythrocytes. This action effectively creates a depot, in which chlorthalidone is slowly leaked back into serum to maintain equilibrium between carbonic anhydrase-bound and free chlorthalidone. The net effect is a much longer duration of action (Carter and Ernst 2018)."

    "section": "Loop Diuretics",
    "text": "Loop Diuretics\nLoop diuretics, including furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide, induce natriuresis by inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the luminal side of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and in the macula densa. Similar to thiazides, these drugs are organic anions and gain access to the renal tubule via active secretion into the proximal tubule by organic anion transporters, whereas glomerular filtration is mostly prevented by their extensive protein binding (Ernst and Moser 2009).\nA comparison of pharmacokinetic properties of loop diuretics is presented in Table 3. Substantial differences exist across this subgroup of diuretics. For example, oral bioavailability is high for torsemide and bumetanide, but only approximately 50% for furosemide. Furosemide also exhibits greater variation in oral bioavailability, both between patients and from day-to-day for a given patient, especially in those with edematous states such as heart failure.\n\n\nTable 3: Pharmacokinetic properties of loop diuretics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiuretic\nBioavailability\nProtein Binding\nRoute\nt1/2 (Normal)\nt1/2 (CKD)\n\n\n\n\nFurosemide\n50% (10% - 100%)\n≥95%\n95% renal\n1.5-2 hrs\n2.8 hrs\n\n\nBumetanide\n80% - 100%\n97%\n100% renal\n1 hr\n1.6 hrs\n\n\nTorsemide\n68% - 100%\n≥99%\n30% renal\n3-4 hrs\n4-5 hrs\n\n\n\n\nOnset of action of the loop diuretics is generally rapid (30 to 60 minutes), with peak effects achieved within about 1-2 hours for bumetanide and torsemide and 6-8 hours for furosemide. Although the elimination half-life of furosemide is short, gastrointestinal absorption is comparatively slow, resulting in ‘absorption-limited kinetics’ that extend furosemide’s duration of action to approximately 6-8 hours, similar to torsemide (Ernst and Moser 2009; Ellison 2019)\nBlood pressure reduction with loop diuretics is contingent on the natriuretic and volume reduction effects of these drugs. However, their relatively short durations of action (on natriuresis) are followed closely by periods of significant antinatriuresis, where sodium and volume are conserved. As a consequence, these agents, especially furosemide, often require multiple doses per day to achieve BP-lowering throughout the 24-hour period. Accordingly, these agents are often reserved for select clinical scenarios in treating hypertension, for example, in patients with significant renal impairment or edematous states (as described above) or, rarely, in combination with thiazides in a strategy known as sequential nephron blockade (Ellison 2019)"

Serum potassium concentration reductions occur relatively soon (3-5 days) after therapy initiation, and typically average 0.4 mEq/L with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day, or its equivalent. Coadministration with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, or renin angiotensin system inhibitors can attenuate this effect. Reductions in magnesium are on the order of 5% to 10% for most patients, although some populations are more susceptible to clinically important hypomagnesemia, including the elderly and those routinely taking high doses of diuretics (e.g., concurrent heart failure). Hyponatremia, particularly with thiazides, can occur acutely or gradually. It is more common with thiazides than loop diuretics, and in older women, those able to restrict sodium intake, and in persons who are dehydrated or with diminished capacity to excrete free water (Carter and Ernst 2018).\nThiazides also are associated with changes in metabolic parameters, including hyperuricemia and hyperglycemia, the latter of which may be related to hypokalemia, although data are conflicting. The clinical significance of these effects is debated but given that gout and diabetes often co-occur with hypertension, monitoring of these parameters, particularly early in therapy, may be warranted in select patient groups (Carter and Ernst 2018)."

The latter effect is mediated through its interaction with the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in epithelial cells of the distal tubule and collecting duct, which promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. Spironolactone, and its analog, eplerenone, are synthetic steroids that exert their antihypertensive effects primarily through competitive blockade of this receptor in the kidney (Epstein and Calhoun 2011).\nThe main pharmacologic differences between these agents relate to their potency and affinity for the MR, their metabolism, and their duration of action. Spironolactone is modestly more potent than eplerenone in competitively inhibiting the MR and has a 10 to 20-fold greater affinity for the MR. However, spironolactone also has a several hundred-fold higher affinity for androgen and progesterone receptors, which accounts for its higher incidence of sex hormone-related side effects (e.g., gynecomastia, suppressed libido, menstrual abnormalities) (Epstein and Calhoun 2011).\nSpironolactone is a prodrug that is metabolized in the liver to a number of active metabolites, most importantly canrenone and 7-\\(\\alpha\\)-spironolactone. The parent compound has a relatively short terminal half-life of ~1.5 hours; however, onset and duration of the drug are mediated primarily by the active metabolites, with half-lives of approximately 12-20 hours (7-\\(\\alpha\\)-spironolactone) and 14-16 hours (canrenone). Both metabolites are potent anti-mineralocorticoids. In contrast, eplerenone is metabolized to inactive compounds and has a relatively shorter half-life of approximately 4-6 hours. As a consequence, for hypertension treatment, eplerenone usually requires twice-daily dosing, compared with once-daily dosing for spironolactone. Eplerenone metabolism is mediated through the CYP3A4 isoenzyme, and strong inhibitors of this isoenzyme can have clinically relevant effects on blood concentrations of eplerenone (Ernst and Moser 2009; Ellison 2019)."

Specifically, these drugs directly inhibit sodium influx in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting tubule and duct by interfering with epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) on the luminal membrane. Their potassium-sparing effect arises by virtue of the fact that potassium secretion and sodium entry are coupled in these segments of the nephron; thus, blocking sodium entry effectively impairs potassium secretion.\nOf the two agents, amiloride has greater avidity for ENaC and is the more potent antihypertensive agent. Indeed, triamterene is used only in combination therapy (typically with hydrochlorothiazide in the U.S.) to mitigate diuretic-induced hypokalemia. Moreover, its use has substantially decreased over time concordant with lower thiazide dosing that leads to less hypokalemia (Carter and Ernst 2018; Epstein and Calhoun 2011)."

Amiloride can be used in patients with significant CKD, although lower doses are generally necessary to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia. Because these agents are typically used in more difficult-to-treat hypertension (e.g., resistant hypertension), and typically on top of background therapy with renin angiotensin inhibitors and other diuretics, careful monitoring of potassium is crucial, particularly early in therapy and following dose adjustments. All potassium-sparing diuretics also have the potential to cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (Ernst and Moser 2009).\nSpironolactone is associated with a number of sexual side effects, most notably gynecomastia, which may occur in up to 10% of patients using typical antihypertensive doses of spironolactone (e.g., 25-50 mg/day), and impotence. Importantly, onset of gynecomastia can be gradual and persist beyond discontinuation of therapy. Other side effects related to spironolactone inhibiting androgen and progesterone receptors include impotence, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities. Spironolactone should also be avoided during pregnancy, as it can adversely affecting sex differentiation of the male fetus during embryogenesis (Carter and Ernst 2018; Epstein and Calhoun 2011)."

    "section": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors",
    "text": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors\nACE inhibitors exert their antihypertensive effect via two pathways: 1) inhibition of ACE, preventing conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and its downstream deleterious effects; and, 2) inhibition of bradykinin degradation. Following initiation of therapy, ACE is markedly suppressed, as is angiotensin II; during chronic therapy, ACE remains suppressed, but angiotensin II often returns to pre-treatment levels. This “ACE escape” or “Ang II escape” phenomenon is thought to be related to a compensatory rise in the production of angiotensin II via ACE-independent mechanisms, such as direct conversion of angiotensinogen or angiotensin I to angiotensin II via chymase, cathepsin G, and tonin. The return to pre-treatment angiotensin II levels does not appear to be correlated with blood pressure changes, as these agents maintain antihypertensive efficacy during long-term treatment despite the escape phenomenon (Fisher and Meagher 2011).\nACE is also largely responsible for bradykinin and other small vasoactive peptide degradation into inactive molecules. Inhibiting ACE increases circulating bradykinin, which in turn activates endothelial \\(\\beta\\)1 and \\(\\beta\\)2 receptors to release prostacyclin and nitric oxide, with resultant vasodilation. This vasodilation contributes to the blood pressure-lowering effects of ACE inhibitors, but the extent of this contribution is not well-characterized (Fisher and Meagher 2011).\nAside from their blood pressure-lowering effects, ACE inhibitors also reduce preload and afterload, increase cardiac output, and prevent the pathogenesis and worsening of left ventricular dysfunction. Angiotensin II causes various deleterious effects in the kidneys and ACE inhibition is known to have renoprotective effects via lowering of intraglomerular pressure and dilation of renal efferent arterioles. Reduced proteinuria, a slowing of progressive deterioration in renal function, especially in diabetic nephropathy, and reduction in the risk of developing end-stage renal disease have all been demonstrated with ACE inhibitors (Fisher and Meagher 2011).\nAll ACE inhibitors have approximately equal blood-pressure lowering effects when administered at equivalent doses. Most ACE inhibitors are prodrugs, requiring transformation to active metabolites that generally have more potent anti-ACE activity and longer durations of action than their parent compounds. The two exceptions are captopril and lisinopril, which do not undergo hepatic activation (Fisher and Meagher 2011).\nACE inhibitor pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are displayed in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively. In general, the major pharmacokinetic differences between agents relate to the half-life, which partially (along with ACE binding) determines duration of action and dosing intervals. Most available ACE inhibitors can be dosed once daily, excepting captopril, which requires 2-3 doses/day; enalapril may also require twice daily dosing in some patients. Trough-to-peak ratios also differ across the class, though most agents have a ratio ≥0.5, an approximate indicator for once-daily dosing. The exceptions are captopril, enalapril, and moexipril. However, moexipril’s active metabolite (moexiprilat) is thought to slowly dissociate from ACE, explaining its longer duration of action (Fisher and Meagher 2011).\n\n\nTable 4: Pharmacokinetic parameters of RAS inhibitors available in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAS Inhibitor\nBioavailability\nProtein Binding\nElimination Route\nElimination t1/2\n\n\n\n\nACE inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Benazepril\n≥37%\n97%\nHepatic (to benazeprilat)\n10-11 hrs (benazeprilat)\n\n\n   Captopril\n75%\n25%-30%\n50% Hepatic\n2 hrs\n\n\n   Enalapril\n60%\n<50%\n60% hydrolysis (to enalaprilat)\n11-14 hrs (enalaprilat)\n\n\n   Fosinopril\n36%\n99% (fosinoprilat)\n50% renal\n12-14 hrs\n\n\n   Lisinopril\n25%\n0%\n100% renal\n12–13 hrs\n\n\n   Moexipril\n13%\n50%\n7% renal\n1 hr (moexipril);–9 hrs (moexiprilat)\n\n\n   Perindopril\n65%–75%\n60% (perindopril);%–20% (perindoprilat)\n5%–10% renal\n1 hr (perindopril);-120 hrs (perindoprilat)\n\n\n   Ramipril\n30%–60%\n73%\n60% renal\n>50 hrs\n\n\n   Quinapril\n60%\n97%\n96% renal\n2–3 hrs\n\n\n   Trandolapril\n70%\n80%\n33% renal\n6–10 hrs\n\n\nARBs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Azilsartan\n60%\n>99%\n55% renal\n11 hrs\n\n\n   Candesartan\n15%\n>99%\n60% renal\n9 hrs\n\n\n   Eprosartan\n15%\n98%\n30% renal\n5-9 hrs\n\n\n   Irbesartan\n70%\n90%–95%\n20% renal\n11-15 hrs\n\n\n   Losartan\n35%\n99%\n10% renal\n1-2 hrs (losartan);-9 hrs (E-3174)\n\n\n   Olmesartan\n29%\n>99%\n40% renal\n14-16 hrs\n\n\n   Telmisartan\n40%–60%\n>99%\n1% renal\n24 hrs\n\n\n   Valsartan\n25%\n95%\n30% renal\n6 hrs\n\n\nDRIs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Aliskiren\n2.5%\n50%\n25% renal\n20-45 hrs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Pharmacodynamic parameters and dosing of RAS inhibitors available in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRAS Inhibitor\nOnset of BP-lowering\nPeak BP-lowering\nDuration of BP-lowering\nTypical Dosing Frequency\nTrough:Peak Ratio\nDose Reduce in Moderate Renal Insufficiency\n\n\n\n\nACE inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Benazepril\n<1 hr\n1-2 hrs\n24 hrs\nOnce daily\n0.4–0.5\nYes\n\n\n   Captopril\n1-1.5 hrs\n1-1.5 hrs\n<24 hrs (dose-dependent)\nTwice or thrice daily 0.25\nYes\n\n\n\n   Enalapril\n1 hr\n4-6 hrs\n≤24 hrs\nOnce or twice daily\n0.3–0.45\nNo\n\n\n   Fosinopril\n1 hr\n2-6 hrs\n24 hrs\nOnce or twice daily\n0.6\nNo\n\n\n   Lisinopril\n1 hr\n4-6 hrs\n24 hrs\nOnce\n0.5–0.6\nYes\n\n\n   Moexipril\n1 hr\n3–6 hrs\n≤24 hrs\nOnce or twice daily\n≤0.1\nNo\n\n\n   Perindopril\n<1 hr\n6 hrs\n24 hrs\nOnce daily\n0.6–0.7\nYes\n\n\n   Ramipril\n1–2 hrs\n3-6 hrs\n24 hrs\nOnce daily\n0.5–0.6\nYes\n\n\n   Quinapril\n<1 hr\n2–4 hrs\n24 hrs\nOnce daily\n0.5\nYes\n\n\n   Trandolapril\n1 hr\n4–10 hrs\n24 hrs\nOnce daily\n0.5–0.9\nNo\n\n\nARBs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Azilsartan\n~1-2 hrs\n1.5–3 hrs\n24 hrs\nOnce daily\n0.6–0.7\nNo\n\n\n   Candesartan\n2-3 hrs\n3–4 hrs\n≤24 hrs\nOnce daily\n0.8–1.0\nYes\n\n\n   Eprosartan\n1-2 hrs\n~2 hrs\n≤24 hrs\nOnce or twice daily\n\n0.3\n\n\n   Irbesartan\n1-2 hrs\n3–6 hrs\n≥24 hrs\nOnce daily\n0.4–0.7\nNo\n\n\n   Losartan\n~1 hr\n1 hr (losartan);-6 hrs (E-3174)\n12-24 hrs\nOnce or twice daily\n0.3–0.7\nNo\n\n\n   Olmesartan\n1-2 hrs\n1–2 hrs\n≥24 hrs\nOnce daily\n0.6–0.7\nNo\n\n\n   Telmisartan\n0.5–1 hrs\n4–6 hrs\n>24 hrs\nOnce daily\n0.9\nNo\n\n\n   Valsartan\n2 hrs\n2–4 hrs\n24 hrs\nOnce daily\n0.6–0.7\nNo\n\n\nDRIs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Aliskiren\n1-2 hrs\n2-4 hrs\n>24 hrs\nOnce daily\n0.6–0.9\nNo"

    "text": "Angiotensin Receptor Blockers\nARBs preferentially bind to, and block, angiotensin II (subtype I) receptors (AT1R) through two common mechanisms: 1) hydrophobic bonds between each drug’s phenyl group and the receptor; and, 2) ionic interactions between each drug’s acidic moiety and the receptor. Receptor blockade prevents angiotensin II from binding and mitigates the deleterious downstream consequences of sodium and volume retention, and aldosterone production, but also prevents the negative feedback loop between AT1R activation and renin production. As a consequence, plasma renin activity is increased during ARB therapy, similarly to ACE inhibitor therapy. Blocking of the angiotensin II–AT1R interaction also shunts angiotensin II to other angiotensin receptor subtypes, including AT2R, with beneficial downstream effects (reduced sodium and volume retention, aldosterone production) (Taylor, Siragy, and Nesbitt 2011).\nARBs have broadly similar blood pressure lowering efficacy at comparable doses. They are also believed to have broadly similar effects on cardiovascular and renal outcomes, i.e., these effects are “class effects,” rather than agent-specific effects. Moreover, they have broadly similar blood pressure lowering efficacy and cardiovascular/renal benefits as compared with ACE inhibitors and are generally considered interchangeable with ACE inhibitors in most clinical situations (Taylor, Siragy, and Nesbitt 2011).\nMost ARBs are administered once daily, although some patients may need twice daily dosing with shorter-acting ARBs (losartan, eprosartan, candesartan). As with ACE inhibitors, duration of action is a function of both half-life and binding dissociation rates at the AT1R. For many of the ARBs (or their active metabolites), slow dissociation leads to longer durations of action (up to a week or more) than predicted based on half-life alone (Taylor, Siragy, and Nesbitt 2011)."

Following aliskiren administration, plasma renin activity, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II levels are suppressed, making it somewhat unique among the RAS inhibitors (Riet et al. 2015).\nAliskiren has very low bioavailability, but is not metabolized significantly, and thus not subject to CYP450-mediated drug-drug interactions. It also has a long half-life, approaching two days, and achieves steady state after ~1 week. Blood pressure-lowering is approximately similar to ACE inhibitors and ARBs during chronic therapy. However, whether aliskiren has the same cardiovascular and renal beneficial effects as the other RAS inhibitors is largely untested. It does not appear to have value as add-on therapy to ACE inhibitors or ARBs (Riet et al. 2015)."

    "text": "Adverse Effects of RAS inhibitors\nAll RAS inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy owing to concerns over fetal toxicity. These agents should also be avoided in severely volume-depleted patients and in those with renal hypoperfusion, including bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis, because these agents can precipitate renal failure in such patients (Izzo and Weir 2011).\nAll RAS inhibitors rarely cause angioedema, although the relative incidence appears greatest in ACE inhibitors, occurring in ~0.2% to 0.3% of patients treated with chronic ACE inhibitor therapy. Patients who have developed angioedema on one RAS inhibitor are at higher risk for angioedema with other RAS inhibitors and these agents are generally not recommended in patients with prior RAS inhibitor-induced angioedem (Izzo and Weir 2011).\nElevations in serum potassium are also common across all 3 RAS inhibitor classes, and potassium monitoring is warranted during therapy initiation and modification. These agents should also be used cautiously with other drugs that elevate serum potassium, including aldosterone antagonists. Similarly, potassium supplements should usually be discontinued when starting RAS inhibitors. Elevations in serum creatinine (and reductions in GFR) are also common, and usually a sign of effective modification of the RAS system because they reflect reduced resistance at the efferent arteriole and corresponding decreased intraglomerular pressure. Generally, minor elevations in serum creatinine (< ~30%) are appropriate and do not warrant therapy adjustment. And, these elevations frequently reverse to pre-treatment levels despite continued use of the RAS inhibitor. Conversely, elevations >50% from baseline should prompt evaluation and therapy discontinuation may be prudent (Izzo and Weir 2011).\nACE inhibitors also very commonly cause an irritating, dry cough, thought to be related to their effect on bradykinin levels. This cough is the most common cause of therapy discontinuation and non-adherence in ACE inhibitors. ARBs and DRIs do not affect bradykinin, or do so to a much lower extent, and are associated with much lower incidences of cough (Taylor, Siragy, and Nesbitt 2011)."

Accordingly, they are not generally used for primary hypertension, but rather reserved for selected patients, most notably in the management of pheochromocytomas either preoperatively, or for longer-term treatment in inoperable patients (phenoxybenzamine only). These agents effectively manage severe elevations in blood pressure and minimize plasma volume contraction and myocardial injury in this setting (Grimm and Flack 2011; Reid 1986)."

Consequently, they lack many of the problematic adverse effects of the non-selective \\(\\alpha\\)-blockers, including reflex tachycardia (Reid 1986).\nThese agents have similar blood pressure-lowering efficacy but differ somewhat in their pharmacokinetic profiles (Table 8). The most prominent difference relates to duration of action. Prazosin has a short duration of action and requires administration in two or three doses/day. Likewise, terazosin may require twice-daily dosing, whereas the long duration of action for doxazosin allows for once-daily dosing (Grimm and Flack 2011).\n\n\nTable 8: Pharmacokinetic properties of selective \\(\\alpha\\)1-blockers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\\alpha$1-blocker\nBioavailability\nTmax\nProtein Binding\nElimination Duration of Action\nElimination t1/2\n\n\n\n\nPrazosin\n50%–70%\n1–3 hrs\n95%\nHepatic\n3 hrs\n\n\nDoxazosin\n60%–70%\n2–3 hrs\n98%\nHepatic\n22 hrs\n\n\nTerazosin\n>90%\n1-2 hrs\n90%–94%\nHepatic\n12 hrs\n\n\n\n\nSelective \\(\\alpha\\)1-blockers are associated with significant postural hypotension and syncope, particularly very early in therapy or with significant upward dose titrations.

Orthostasis is also relatively common during long-term treatment with these agents (Grimm and Flack 2011; Reid 1986).\nAll \\(\\alpha\\)-blockers cause renal sodium absorption and expansion of extracellular fluid volume and weight gain and swelling are commonly reported adverse effects.

    "section": "Hydralazine and Minoxidil",
    "text": "Hydralazine and Minoxidil\nThe exact mechanism of action by which hydralazine relaxes smooth muscle is not well understood but is presumed to involve a reduction in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Hydralazine is also believed to have antioxidant effects via inhibition of reactive oxygen species in the vasculature, which may contribute to its vasodilatory effects. Minoxidil is largely inactive, but undergoes metabolism to its active form, minoxidil N-O sulfate, which activates ATP-modulated K+ channels and hyperpolarizes and relaxes smooth muscle in resistance arteries (Cohn, McInnes, and Shepherd 2011; Sica and Gehr 2001).\nBoth of these drugs prompt compensatory mechanisms that counteract the vasodilatory-mediated blood pressure lowering effects. Specifically, they cause baroreceptor reflex-mediated vasoconstriction and, in combination with other mechanisms, an increase in sympathetic activation and cardiac output. The latter can manifest as tachycardia, palpitation, flushing, and headache, particularly when first starting therapy. They also cause substantial excess sodium and fluid retention by reducing renal perfusion pressures and by sympathetic stimulation of renin release. Accordingly, these agents almost always require concurrent treatment with a \\(\\beta\\)-blocker (or, central sympatholytic) and diuretic (often loop diuretic, especially with minoxidil) to prevent these deleterious effects. Additionally, absent these concurrent therapies, pseudotolerance often develops, whereby the drugs maintain their vasodilatory activity, but the aforementioned compensatory mechanisms (vasoconstriction, increased cardiac output, increased fluid retention) effectively cancel out the blood pressure reductions (Cohn, McInnes, and Shepherd 2011; Sica and Gehr 2001; McComb, Chao, and Ng 2016).\nPharmacokinetic properties of hydralazine and minoxidil are presented in Table 9. Hydralazine is metabolized in part by acetylation and rapid acetylators exhibit greater first-pass metabolism of hydralazine, lower plasma concentrations, and less antihypertensive benefit than slow acetylators. The duration of action of hydralazine is disproportionately long, given its half-life, presumably because hydralazine binds avidly in vascular tissue. In most patients, three daily doses are sufficient to maintain blood pressure throughout the 24-hour period. Minoxidil has a much longer duration of action and can be effectively dosed once daily. Minoxidil also does not require dose adjustments in the setting of renal impairment, whereas hydralazine dosing frequency may need to be reduced (i.e., to once or twice daily) in the setting of severe renal impairment (Cohn, McInnes, and Shepherd 2011; Sica and Gehr 2001).\n\n\nTable 9: Pharmacokinetic properties of direct arterial vasodilators.

    "text": "Sodium Nitroprusside\nSodium nitroprusside is thought to cause vasodilation by nitric oxide donation. It also dilates resistance arterioles and lowers peripheral vascular resistance. In contrast to hydralazine and minoxidil, nitroprusside has little effect on heart rate and reduces myocardial oxygen demand, thus it is not associated with some of the adverse cardiac effects of these other agents. However, similar to hydralazine and minoxidil, nitroprusside can enhance propagation of aortic dissection and should be administered with concurrent \\(\\beta\\)-blocker therapy (Cohn, McInnes, and Shepherd 2011).\nNitroprusside is generally reserved for treatment of hypertensive emergency, usually in the intensive care setting. It is administered via controlled infusion, with an onset of antihypertensive action <30 seconds, and peak effects within 1-2 minutes. Blood pressure returns to pre-treatment levels within approximately 3 minutes of discontinuing the nitroprusside infusion (Cohn, McInnes, and Shepherd 2011).\nSide effects of nitroprusside are primarily related to its rapid hypotensive effects, i.e., excessive vasodilation. However, it can also be converted to cyanide and thiocyanate and cause severe lactic acidosis in patients receiving high doses or prolonged treatment (e.g., >24 hours) (Cohn, McInnes, and Shepherd 2011)."

    "text": "Centrally acting Sympatholytics\nCentrally acting sympatholytics used in the treatment of hypertension include clonidine, methyldopa, guanfacine, and guanabenz, as well as imidazoline receptor agonists, moxonidine and rilmenidine. These agents lower blood pressure through stimulation of central post-synaptic \\(\\alpha\\)2-adrenergic receptors, imidazoline 1 (I1) receptors, or both in the brainstem’s SNS control centers. However, differences in receptor selectivity exist among these agents: - Non-selective agents: Clonidine - \\(\\alpha\\)2-selective agents: Methyldopa, guanfacine, and guanabenz - I1-selective agents (not marketed in the U.S.): Moxonidine and rilmenidine\nStimulation of these receptors, in turn, suppresses sympathetic outflow to the heart, blood vessels and kidneys. Other notable reactions to stimulation include: - Reduced norepinephrine release (and thus less \\(\\alpha\\)1- and \\(\\beta\\)1-receptor stimulation), leading to decreased peripheral vascular resistance - Diminished baroreceptor reflex compensation, and decreased heart rate and cardiac output - Decreased renin release, leading to suppressed angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and aldosterone production (McComb, Chao, and Ng 2016).\nAll of these mechanisms contribute to the blood pressure-lowering effects of these agents, particularly early in therapy, though the relative contributions are not well-characterized. Effects on heart rate and cardiac output are generally seen more at rest than with exercise. With chronic treatment, cardiac output tends to return to pretreatment levels, whereas the reduction in peripheral vascular resistance is sustained in most patients. However, some patients develop tolerance to the antihypertensive effects of these drugs during long-term therapy (Grassi 2016).\nPharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the centrally acting sympatholytics are summarized in Table 10. Because all of these agents must cross the blood-brain barrier to impart their antihypertensive effect, there is a lag time between achieving plasma drug concentration and clinical antihypertensive effects, equal to the time required to achieve sufficient drug concentrations in the brainstem. Accordingly, some common general pharmacokinetic measures, such as Tmax, may be misleading with regard to determining differences in antihypertensive effect onset and duration within this class (McComb, Chao, and Ng 2016).\n\n\nTable 10: Pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of centrally acting sympatholytics marketed in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug\nOral Bioavailability\nProtein Binding\nElimination Route\nElimination t1/2\nOnset of Action\nDuration of Action\n\n\n\n\n\nClonidine (oral)\n100%\n20%–40%\n50% hepatic\n~12 hrs (41 hrs)\n0.5–1 hr\n~8 hrs\n\n\n\nCloinidine (transdermal)\nNA\n20%-40%\n50% hepatic\n~20 hrs\n2–3 days\n1 week\n\n\n\nGuanabenz\n75%\n90%\n≥95% hepatic\n4–6 hrs\n1 hr\n~12 hrs\n\n\n\nGuanfacine\n80%\n70%\n50% hepatic\n12–24 hrs\n~1 hr\n~24 hrs\n\n\n\nMethyldopa\n25%\n<20%\n70% renal\n1.5–2 hrs (4-6 hrs)\n~1 hr\n6–8 hrs\n\n\n\n\n\nThese agents have generally similar blood pressure lowering effects at equipotent doses, with an important caveat related to clonidine. Clonidine is typically administered either orally or transdermal. Oral administration has a much faster onset of action, but a relatively short duration of action, requiring 3 doses/day in most patients. Moreover, oral administration of clonidine results in significant peak and trough concentrations. These varied concentrations throughout the day can lead to substantial blood pressure variability. Moreover, trough periods can lead to substantial rebound hypertension (with severely elevated blood pressure) and other symptoms of sympathetic overactivity (headache, anxiety, palpitation, tremor), especially in patients who are not adherent. Conversely, transdermal application of clonidine (i.e., to the upper arm) results in much slower onset of action because the drug must be released from the adhesive layer (usually within ≤8 hours of application), then must fix to skin proteins before being released into the blood stream and, eventually, cross the blood-brain barrier to reach α2 receptors. Thereafter, clonidine is released from the patch reservoir at a constant rate, at least until the patch reservoir has been substantially depleted (≤ ~40% saturation), which does not occur until 9 days or more following application. When the patch is replaced weekly, this level of depletion is not reached. On patch removal, residual drug in the skin serves as a reservoir, leading to a more gradual downward slope in clonidine concentration. As a consequence, rebound hypertension is much less common and less severe than with transdermal versus oral clonidine. Similarly, rebound hypertension occurs less often with guanfacine, probably as a function of its relatively longer half-life (Vongpatanasin et al. 2011).\nIn contrast to α1 blockers, α\\(\\alpha\\)2 agonists do not greatly affect postural reflexes and orthostasis is infrequent and generally mild when it does occur. However, all \\(\\alpha\\)2 agonists are associated with significant dry mouth and CNS side effects, including sedation and fatigue. These adverse effects are major causes of treatment discontinuation and nonadherence, and are most pronounced with oral clonidine, guanfacine, and guanabenz, but considerably less so with transdermal clonidine. Methyldopa does cause sedation and fatigue, but these effects are usually transient and less severe than with the other \\(\\alpha\\)2 agonists. Additionally, CNS effects are more pronounced when these drugs are used in combination with other CNS-depressing drugs, including benzodiazepines, ethanol, and sedative-hypnotics. Methyldopa also has other significant side effects, particularly with longer-term therapy, including a positive Coombs test (10% to 20% of long-term users), hemolytic anemia, and lupus-like syndrome (Vongpatanasin et al. 2011).\nContraindications differ somewhat between agents. Methyldopa has also been extensively used in pregnant women and does not affect maternal cardiac output, uterine blood flow, or renal blood flow and is not known to adversely affect the fetus, nor is it distributed significantly into breast milk. Accordingly, methyldopa is often considered a first-line therapy for treatment of pre-existing hypertension during pregnancy and immediately post-partum. Conversely, guanabenz should be avoided in pregnancy. Active hepatic disease should prompt avoidance of guanabenz and methyldopa. Significant renal impairment warrants dose adjustments or less frequent dosing for clonidine, methyldopa, and possibly guanfacine, but not for guanabenz (McComb, Chao, and Ng 2016; Vongpatanasin et al. 2011)."

Reserpine depletes norepinephrine (and other neurotransmitters, including 5-HT) levels in the peripheral sympathetic nerves, brain, adrenal medulla, and other tissues. The mechanism of action is believed to be inhibition of the ATP/Mg2+ pump responsible for sequestering norepinephrine into storage granules in postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings. Because transport to these storage granules is prevented, the catecholamines, including norepinephrine, are metabolized by monoamine oxidase. This activity results in reduced peripheral vascular resistance, in a similar fashion to that seen with post-synaptic \\(\\alpha\\)1- and \\(\\alpha\\)2-blockade. Heart rate is also decreased with reserpine administration (McComb, Chao, and Ng 2016).\nBecause reserpine affects brain tissue sympathetic nerve endings as well, central nervous system side effects, e.g., sedation, fatigue, depression and nasal stuffiness, are common with this drug, particularly at higher doses (≥0.75 mg/day). Conversely, lower doses (0.05 to 0.5 mg/day) are usually effective and well-tolerated, particularly when combined with diuretics. Reserpine is extremely long-acting, with a terminal half-life of 8 to 9 days, and can be dosed once daily (McComb, Chao, and Ng 2016; Vongpatanasin et al. 2011)."

    "text": "Initial Antihypertensive Regimens in Newly Treated Patients: Real World Evidence from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Network\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground: Knowledge of real-world antihypertensive use is limited to prevalent hypertension, limiting our understanding of how treatment evolves and its contribution to persistently poor BP control. We sought to characterize antihypertensive initiation among new users. Methods and Results: Using Medicaid and Medicare data from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium, we identified new users of ≥1 first-line antihypertensives (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI], calcium channel blocker [CCB], angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB], thiazide diuretic, or β-blocker) between 2013 and 2021 among adults with diagnosed hypertension, and no antihypertensive fill during the 12 months prior. We evaluated initial antihypertensive regimens by class and drug overall and across study years, and examined variation in antihypertensive initiation across demographic (sex, race, ethnicity), comorbidity (chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). We identified 143,054 patients initiating 188,995 antihypertensives (75% monotherapy; 25% combination therapy), with mean age, 59 years and 57% of whom were women. The most commonly initiated antihypertensive class overall was ACEIs (39%) followed by β-blockers (31%), CCBs (24%), thiazides (19%), and ARBs (11%). Excepting β-blockers, a single drug accounted for ≥75% of use of each class. β-blocker use decreased (35% to 26%) and CCB use increased (24% to 28%) over the study period, while initiation of most other classes remained relatively stable. We also observed significant differences in antihypertensive selection across demographic and comorbidity strata. Conclusions: These findings indicate substantial variation exists in initial antihypertensive prescribing and there remain significant gaps between current guideline recommendations and real-world implementation in early hypertension care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteven M.

    "text": "National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute\n\n\n\nK01 HL138172\n\n\n\nSteven Smith\n\n\n\nJuly 2018 - June 2023\n\n\n\nThe current hypertension (HTN) treatment paradigm of trial-and-error drug selection has remained essentially unchanged for nearly half a century. Personalizing care has been challenging because patients and clinicians too often lack adequate evidence to inform individual care decisions. But, broad electronic health record (EHR) adoption has created opportunities for using routinely-collected clinical data to inform evidence. Applying principles of causal inference, such data can be used to identify clinical factors that influence observed variation in treatment response and, in turn, incorporate these factors into statistical models for predicting future treatment response for individuals. The overall objective with this project is to better understand real world use of antihypertensive drugs and factors that influence response to such drugs, with the goal of creating prediction models for use in clinical decision support tools to make personalized HTN management recommendations. The specific research aims include characterizing real world antihypertensive drug prescribing patterns and their determinants (Aim 1), identifying treatment effect modifiers for both effectiveness and safety of two common antihypertensive classes, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and thiazide diuretics (Aim 2) and, developing models for predicting response to ACE-Is and thiazide diuretics to maximize antihypertensive efficacy (Aim 3). This work will leverage observational research methodologies with the OneFlorida Data Trust, a statewide repository of longitudinal EHR data on &gt;8 million Floridians.\n\n\n\n\nSmith KM, et al. Initial antihypertensive prescribing in relation to blood pressure among Florida Medicaid and Medicare recipients in the OneFlorida+ Research Consortium.

    "text": "National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute\n\n\n\nR21 HL159576\n\n\n\nSteven Smith\n\n\n\nJuly 2022 - June 2024\n\n\n\nHypertension (HTN) is prevalent in nearly half of U.S. adults and treated with &gt;3 million antihypertensive prescription fills per day in the U.S. Although commonly-used antihypertensives are generally well-tolerated, their ubiquitous use exposes millions of adults to potentially treatment-limiting adverse events (AEs), some of which are well-known, but many are non-specific or indistinguishable from HTN-related symptoms and not easily attributed to the offending antihypertensive. Failure to associate these AEs with the causative agent may prompt additional therapy to treat the AE—known as a “prescribing cascade”—with potentially important implications regarding polypharmacy, unnecessary costs, exposure to additional side effects, treatment nonadherence, and reduced quality of life, especially in older adults. Most prescribing cascade studies to date have been narrowly focused on drugs with a well-known AE that is highly specific to the drug, severely limiting our understanding of prescribing cascades occurring due to less well-known or non-specific AEs. This approach has resulted in slow knowledge generation and missed opportunities for comprehensively assessing and discovering new prescribing cascades. In line with NHLBI Strategic Objective 7 to “leverage emerging opportunities in data science to open new frontiers in research,” this proposal seeks to develop and utilize a novel methodologic approach for high-throughput screening of prescribing cascades and discover novel antihypertensive prescribing cascades using a nationally-representative administrative claims data source. This goal will be achieved via the following Aims: 1) elucidate candidate antihypertensive-related prescribing cascades using the SIDe Effect Resource, a collection of prescription labeling which include drug AEs and drug indications; 2) identify prescribing cascade signals occurring during real world use of antihypertensives using a Medicare database; and, 3) classify cascade signal detection and prioritize further research via an expert panel. The proposed work is expected to 1) identify and characterize the magnitude of common antihypertensive prescribing cascades, including those previously unknown; 2) develop an efficient framework for wide-scale assessment of prescribing cascade detection; and, 3) establish the basis for a compendium of known cascades. This proposal also builds logically towards future research applying this framework for discovery of prescribing cascades with cardiovascular (and other) treatments, assessing downstream consequences of prescribing cascades, and testing clinical decision support aids to prevent prescribing cascades.\n\n\n\n\nWang GH, et al. Modifiable statin characteristics associated with potential statin-related prescribing cascades.

    "text": "Hypertension affects an estimated 120 million individuals in the U.S. and is the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death.1 Nearly all of these individuals ultimately require antihypertensive therapy to achieve blood pressure (BP) control, and as a consequence, several antihypertensive drugs are among the most commonly used medications worldwide. Consensus U.S. and international guidelines have long recommended certain antihypertensive classes as ‘first-line’ therapies – namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and, until relatively recently, β-blockers.2,3 However, for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, guidelines generally do not prioritize any of these classes except in select circumstances, leaving prescribers to choose from some 30 to 40 antihypertensive drugs when initiating antihypertensive therapy.\nReal world antihypertensive utilization patterns have been studied extensively, but in almost all cases, the focus of these studies has been on treatment patterns in prevalent hypertension cohorts.4–14 These studies provide useful insight into overall antihypertensive use in populations. However, they rarely have distinguished between patients who are early in their treatment course from those with long-standing hypertension and who may have extensive treatment histories and multi-drug regimens that have evolved over time. Thus, very little is known about contemporary patterns of early antihypertensive care, including initial antihypertensive regimens, and to what extent these accord with care typically recommended in consensus guidelines. These gaps are noteworthy in light of the fact that only approximately one in five U.S. patients with hypertension have BP controlled to <130/80 mm Hg.1 Thus, delays in achieving BP control are exceedingly common in routine practice and extend high-risk periods, leading to worse outcomes.12,15 A greater understanding of how antihypertensive regimens emerge and evolve early in therapy may aid in identifying quality care gaps that can be intervened on.\nTo address this gap, we used the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium (hereafter, OneFlorida+) to characterize initial treatment regimens among a diverse cohort of new users of antihypertensive therapy. We were principally interested in the distribution of classes, specific antihypertensive drugs within classes, how these distributions differed in pre-specified demographic and clinical groups, and their trends over time."

    "text": "The Cardiovascular Medications Lab (CVmedLab) at the University of Florida investigates real world safety and effectiveness of cardiovascular medications. We ask questions like how are cardiovascular diseases treated in the real world and how do these treatment regimens evolve over time? Are certain medications more effective than others for a particular cardiovascular disease? To what extent are well-known disparities in cardiovascular disease outcomes explained by differences in treatment approaches? These kinds of questions are investigated using observational data (e.g., electronic health records, insurance claims data) and epidemiologic methods, as well as with prospective clinical trials. The CVmedLab uses a variety of computational methods and tools to conduct and communicate research.\nCurrent and previous lab members include graduate students pursuing master’s or doctoral degrees, postdoctoral researcher associates, and Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) students. If you are interested in cardiovascular disease treatment and using computational techniques for designing and executing studies, analyzing data, and developing new technologies, then you may be interested in joining the team.\nThe lab is located in the Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy in the College of Pharmacy at UF, and affiliated with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety and the Center for Integrative Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease."

    "text": "This year, 2023, marks 100 years since the College of Pharmacy opened its doors at the University of Florida. The Florida Pharmacy Association first recommended the state establish a school of Pharmacy back in 1895, but it took 28 years for that to happen, with UF enrolling the first class, 45 students, in 1923. Since that time, the UF COP has had a lot of firsts: the first UF college to offer the PhD (1930); graduated the first woman with a masters degree from UF (1932); the first co-ed college at UF (1935); and, graduating UF’s first African-American PhD (Ira Robinson; 1966).\nUF has had some knocks in the last year or two, but we’re still confident we can carry on the tradition of progress, creating excellent scientists, and moving the field of pharmacy and pharmaceutical outcomes forward."

    "text": "National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute\n\n\n\n2R01HL132448\n\n\n\nSteven Smith, Carl Pepine\n\n\n\nFebruary 2024 - January 2029\n\n\n\nHypertension (HTN) is the most prevalent modifiable risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and disorders directly influencing CVD (i.e., diabetes, chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, etc.). Despite lifestyle changes and drug therapy advances, ~20-30% of patients with treated HTN are “resistant” to (require ≥3) antihypertensive drugs. TRH is generally thought to originate through volume overload and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction that impairs immune function and inflammatory response. However, few treatment options are available for patients with TRH and promising procedures (e.g., renal artery sympathetic denervation) remain inaccessible to most. Thus, a mechanism-based breakthrough is imperative to foster development of novel medical-based strategies to better control blood pressure (BP) and potentially cure and/or prevent TRH. Our prior work provides strong evidence for an altered gut microbiota-gut leakiness- neuroinflammation interaction hypothesis in which gut dysbiosis and gut leakiness, combined with neuroinflammation, perpetuate neurogenic HTN and contribute to TRH and possibly to racial disparities in TRH (Figure 1). We have also shown that minocycline, an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties, appears to reduce BP in animal HTN models as well as among patients with TRH. In this project, we propose to elucidate mechanisms that underlie the effects of minocycline on BP-lowering in White and African American individuals with TRH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nOur overarching objective is to test the hypothesis that minocycline rebalances gut dysbiosis, namely by increasing butyrate-producing functional capacity, attenuating gut-mediated inflammatory response and gut leakiness, and that these effects explain BP-lowering effects in TRH. Four specific aims are proposed to support/refute this altered gut microbiota-gut leakiness- neuroinflammation interaction hypothesis in TRH:\n\nAim 1 will investigate the hypothesis that minocycline alters gut microbiota (primarily butyrate-producing capacity) that mediates minocycline-induced BP lowering in TRH.\nAim 2 will assess the extent to which minocycline alters gut-associated inflammation and gut leakiness, and their response with BP changes after minocycline treatment.\nAim 3 will evaluate the hypothesis that minocycline reduces neuroinflammation in TRH.\nAim 4 will evaluate the hypothesis that these effects of minocycline differ in White versus African American individuals.\n\nTogether, these studies will elucidate ANS-based mechanisms of host-microbiota interactions in TRH, evaluate potential of minocycline to reduce TRH, and serve as proof of concept for other therapeutic options that rebalance microbiota or mitigate TRH-associated inflammation, to improve BP control in patients with TRH, who remain at high risk.\n\n\n\n\nPepine CJ, et al. Potential of Minocycline for Treatment of Resistant Hypertension.

Failure to associate these AEs with the causative agent may prompt additional therapy to treat the AE—known as a “prescribing cascade”—with potentially important implications regarding polypharmacy, unnecessary costs, exposure to additional side effects, treatment nonadherence, and reduced quality of life, especially in older adults. Most prescribing cascade studies to date have been narrowly focused on drugs with a well-known AE that is highly specific to the drug, severely limiting our understanding of prescribing cascades occurring due to less well-known or non-specific AEs. This approach has resulted in slow knowledge generation and missed opportunities for comprehensively assessing and discovering new prescribing cascades. In line with NHLBI Strategic Objective 7 to “leverage emerging opportunities in data science to open new frontiers in research,” this proposal seeks to develop and utilize a novel methodologic approach for high-throughput screening of prescribing cascades and discover novel antihypertensive prescribing cascades using a nationally-representative administrative claims data source. This goal will be achieved via the following Aims: 1) elucidate candidate antihypertensive-related prescribing cascades using the SIDe Effect Resource, a collection of prescription labeling which include drug AEs and drug indications; 2) identify prescribing cascade signals occurring during real world use of antihypertensives using a Medicare database; and, 3) classify cascade signal detection and prioritize further research via an expert panel. The proposed work is expected to 1) identify and characterize the magnitude of common antihypertensive prescribing cascades, including those previously unknown; 2) develop an efficient framework for wide-scale assessment of prescribing cascade detection; and, 3) establish the basis for a compendium of known cascades. This proposal also builds logically towards future research applying this framework for discovery of prescribing cascades with cardiovascular (and other) treatments, assessing downstream consequences of prescribing cascades, and testing clinical decision support aids to prevent prescribing cascades.\n\n\n\n\nWang GH, et al. Modifiable statin characteristics associated with potential statin-related prescribing cascades.

Personalizing care has been challenging because patients and clinicians too often lack adequate evidence to inform individual care decisions. But, broad electronic health record (EHR) adoption has created opportunities for using routinely-collected clinical data to inform evidence. Applying principles of causal inference, such data can be used to identify clinical factors that influence observed variation in treatment response and, in turn, incorporate these factors into statistical models for predicting future treatment response for individuals. The overall objective with this project is to better understand real world use of antihypertensive drugs and factors that influence response to such drugs, with the goal of creating prediction models for use in clinical decision support tools to make personalized HTN management recommendations. The specific research aims include characterizing real world antihypertensive drug prescribing patterns and their determinants (Aim 1), identifying treatment effect modifiers for both effectiveness and safety of two common antihypertensive classes, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and thiazide diuretics (Aim 2) and, developing models for predicting response to ACE-Is and thiazide diuretics to maximize antihypertensive efficacy (Aim 3).

Despite lifestyle changes and drug therapy advances, ~20-30% of patients with treated HTN are “resistant” to (require ≥3) antihypertensive drugs. TRH is generally thought to originate through volume overload and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction that impairs immune function and inflammatory response. However, few treatment options are available for patients with TRH and promising procedures (e.g., renal artery sympathetic denervation) remain inaccessible to most. Thus, a mechanism-based breakthrough is imperative to foster development of novel medical-based strategies to better control blood pressure (BP) and potentially cure and/or prevent TRH. Our prior work provides strong evidence for an altered gut microbiota-gut leakiness- neuroinflammation interaction hypothesis in which gut dysbiosis and gut leakiness, combined with neuroinflammation, perpetuate neurogenic HTN and contribute to TRH and possibly to racial disparities in TRH (Figure 1). We have also shown that minocycline, an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties, appears to reduce BP in animal HTN models as well as among patients with TRH. In this project, we propose to elucidate mechanisms that underlie the effects of minocycline on BP-lowering in White and African American individuals with TRH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nOur overarching objective is to test the hypothesis that minocycline rebalances gut dysbiosis, namely by increasing butyrate-producing functional capacity, attenuating gut-mediated inflammatory response and gut leakiness, and that these effects explain BP-lowering effects in TRH. Four specific aims are proposed to support/refute this altered gut microbiota-gut leakiness- neuroinflammation interaction hypothesis in TRH:\n\nAim 1 will investigate the hypothesis that minocycline alters gut microbiota (primarily butyrate-producing capacity) that mediates minocycline-induced BP lowering in TRH.\nAim 2 will assess the extent to which minocycline alters gut-associated inflammation and gut leakiness, and their response with BP changes after minocycline treatment.\nAim 3 will evaluate the hypothesis that minocycline reduces neuroinflammation in TRH.\nAim 4 will evaluate the hypothesis that these effects of minocycline differ in White versus African American individuals.\n\nTogether, these studies will elucidate ANS-based mechanisms of host-microbiota interactions in TRH, evaluate potential of minocycline to reduce TRH, and serve as proof of concept for other therapeutic options that rebalance microbiota or mitigate TRH-associated inflammation, to improve BP control in patients with TRH, who remain at high risk.\n\n\n\n\nPepine CJ, et al. Potential of Minocycline for Treatment of Resistant Hypertension.
