It's that time of year again to welcome some new members to the lab. We have two PhD students joining this fall. 

Shu Niu, a 3rd year PhD student, who comes to us from Mikael Svensson's lab. She is primarily focused on cardio-oncology, i.e., the intersection of chemotherapy and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, which represents a somewhat new area of focus for us. 

Tram Nguyen is a 1st year PhD student, who just completed her Master's in Pharmacoepi/Pharmacoecon at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.
