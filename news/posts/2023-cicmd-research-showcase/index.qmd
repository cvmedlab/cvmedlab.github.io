We had a great showing at the 2023 [Center for Integrative Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease (CICMD)](https://cicmd.center.ufl.edu/) annual early career research showcase at the Harn Museum of Art in Gainesville. This is a great opportunity for the CICMD to showcase the great research our students and postdocs are doing. Four students presented work from our lab, including Shailina, Asinamai, and Kayla, each presenting poster presentations. **Shailina was awarded the top clinical/population sciences poster presentation, along with a cash prize.** Congratulations, Shailina! In addition, Earl Morris presented his work on xanthine oxidase inhibitor trajectories and their association with CV events in the oral platform presentation competition, and **was awarded a 3rd place prize**. Congrats, Earl!
