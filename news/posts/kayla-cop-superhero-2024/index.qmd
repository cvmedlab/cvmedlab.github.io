More good news this week for our 2nd year graduate student [Kayla Smith](https://pop.pharmacy.ufl.edu/people/students/kayla-smith/), who was selected as one of eight **2023-24 COP Superhero award winners**, which recognizes Kayla's efforts above and beyond expectations in the graduate program. The Superhero award is generally recognized as a 'top award' for our graduate program and is a college-wide award. This is a highly competitive award, and Kayla was one of three recipients this year from our department. Congratulations, Kayla!
