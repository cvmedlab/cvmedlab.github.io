Excellent news this week for our 3rd year graduate student [Asinamai Ndai](https://pop.pharmacy.ufl.edu/people/students/asinamai-ndai/), who was [selected as one of three winners](https://pharmacy.ufl.edu/2023/11/14/asinamai-ndai-presented-the-alec-courtelis-award/) of the [Alec Courtelis Award](https://internationalcenter.ufl.edu/home/awards-opportunities/international-student-scholarships-awards), which recognizes the top international PhD students across all of UF. This is a highly competitive award, and I believe Asinamai may be only the second winner ever from the College of Pharmacy. Congratulations, Asinamai!

Several of us, including Asinamai's other advisor, [Dr. Rachel Reise](https://pop.pharmacy.ufl.edu/profile/reise-rachel/), and [Motomori Lewis](https://pop.pharmacy.ufl.edu/people/students/motomori-lewis-b-s/), had a lovely evening celebrating Asinamai and all the other award winners at the International Student Achievement Awards ceremony, hosted at the Touchdown Terrace at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. And, I was fortunate enough to have the honor to talk about Asinamai's many accomplishments and present him with his award. 

Here are some pictures from the evening:
