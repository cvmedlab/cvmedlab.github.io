Our lab has been collaborating with the Vouri Lab and now leading multiple projects using high-throughput screening with large-scale sequence symmetry analysis to detect prescribing cascades. One of these projects, funded internally by the UF COP [PROSPER program](https://facultyaffairs.pharmacy.ufl.edu/faculty-resources/educational-resources/college-of-pharmacy-prosper-excellence-awards/), focused on statins. The first paper from that project has [now been published](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pds.5607) in *Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety*. 

If you don't have access to PDS, see below for a PDF copy of the paper. More to come from this and our other similar project on antihypertensives!
