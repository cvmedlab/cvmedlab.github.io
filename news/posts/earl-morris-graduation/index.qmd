Congratulations to our very own Dr. (Dr.) Earl Morris, who was conferred his PhD degree on Saturday, August 12th, 2023. He was one of two grad students from our department (along with Phoenix, pictured below) who graduated this semester. We had a great time celebrating Earl and Phoenix's achievements at Dr. Winterstein's lake house.

But, we're in luck, because Earl is sticking around as the newest faculty hire in the UF Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy. Looking forward to having him as a colleague!

Here we are before the commencement ceremony.
