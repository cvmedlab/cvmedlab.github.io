Our lab had a great showing at the 2023 COP Research Showcase, with posters by each of our graduate students.

Shailina presented on our work in the Personalized Hypertension Care project, funded by NHLBI. Her poster focused on sex and race disparities in initial antihypertensive prescribing, and whether such disparities are explained by differences in clinical factors between these populations.

Here's her poster:
