	abstract = {Objective To determine the average reduction in blood pressure, prevalence of adverse effects, and reduction in risk of stroke and ischaemic heart disease events produced by the five main categories of blood pressure lowering drugs according to dose, singly and in combination.
Design Meta-analysis of 354 randomised double blind placebo controlled trials of thiazides, β blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and calcium channel blockers in fixed dose.
Subjects 40 000 treated patients and 16 000 patients given placebo.
Main outcome measures Placebo adjusted reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and prevalence of adverse effects, according to dose expressed as a multiple of the standard (recommended) doses of the drugs.
Results All five categories of drug produced similar reductions in blood pressure. The average reduction was 9.1 mm Hg systolic and 5.5 mm Hg diastolic at standard dose and 7.1 mm Hg systolic and 4.4 mm Hg diastolic (20\% lower) at half standard dose. The drugs reduced blood pressure from all pretreatment levels, more so from higher levels; for a 10 mm Hg higher blood pressure the reduction was 1.0 mm Hg systolic and 1.1 mm Hg diastolic greater. The blood pressure lowering effects of different categories of drugs were additive. Symptoms attributable to thiazides, β blockers, and calcium channel blockers were strongly dose related; symptoms caused by ACE inhibitors (mainly cough) were not dose related. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists caused no excess of symptoms. The prevalence of symptoms with two drugs in combination was less than additive. Adverse metabolic effects (such as changes in cholesterol or potassium) were negligible at half standard dose.
Conclusions Combination low dose drug treatment increases efficacy and reduces adverse effects. From the average blood pressure in people who have strokes (150/90 mm Hg) three drugs at half standard dose are estimated to lower blood pressure by 20 mm Hg systolic and 11 mm Hg diastolic and thereby reduce the risk of stroke by 63\% and ischaemic heart disease events by 46\% at age 60-69.},

As a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease in this high-risk population, treatment of hypertension in CKD is important. We review the mechanisms and indications for the major classes of antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, β-adrenergic blocking agents, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor blockers, direct vasodilators, and centrally acting α-agonists. Recent evidence suggests that β-adrenergic blocking agents may have a greater role in patients on dialysis and that thiazide diuretics may have a greater role in patients with advanced CKD. We conclude with sharing our general prescribing algorithm for both patients with predialysis CKD and patients with ESKD on dialysis.},

Examples include most thiazide diuretics, propranolol, oxprenolol, atenolol, methyldopa, hydralazine and captopril. These very high doses have usually resulted from studies in which doses have been increased at regular intervals until the desired antihypertensive effect has been achieved or until unacceptable adverse effects have resulted. Frequently the starting doses were too high and the intervals between dose adjustment too short. In many case these large doses resulted in unnecessary adverse effects—the adverse biochemical effects of thiazide diuretics, nephrotic syndrome, taste disturbances and neutropenia with captopril, the lupus syndrome with hydralazine and the central nervous system effects of methyldopa. Parallel group design with single doses and sufficient statistical power to distinguish between the upper and lower ends of the antihypertensive dose-response realtionship should replace the dose-escalating design.},

Key Points and Practical Recommendations • Although chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide are structurally similar, they are very different pharmacokinetically, with chlorthalidone having both an extremely long half-life (approximately 40 to 60 hours) and a large volume of distribution, with gradual elimination from the plasma compartment by tubular secretion. • Furosemide usage, the most widely used diuretic in the loop diuretic class, can be complicated by extremely erratic absorption, with a bioavailability range of 12\% to 112\%. • Chlorthalidone, at a dose of 25 mg, is comparatively more potent than 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, particularly as related to overnight blood pressure reduction. • In ALLHAT, there was no difference among chlorthalidone, amlodipine, lisinopril, and doxazosin for the primary outcome or mortality. • Secondary outcomes were similar except for a 38\% higher rate of heart failure with amlodipine; a 10\% higher rate of combined cardiovascular disease, a 15\% higher rate of stroke, and a 19\% higher rate of heart failure with lisinopril; and a 20\% higher rate of cardiovascular disease, a 20\% higher rate of stroke (40\% higher rate in blacks), and an 80\% higher rate of heart failure with doxazosin, compared with chlorthalidone. • The ACCOMPLISH study may affect future practice guidelines as a result of its findings favoring the amlodipine/benazepril combination; however, the generalizability to patient populations with a lesser cardiovascular risk profile remains in question and the dose of hydrochlorothiazide was only 12.5 mg to 25 mg daily, which was a dose lower than that used in placebo-controlled trials using hydrochlorothiazide. • Certain low-renin patient groups (eg, blacks, the elderly, and diabetics) as well as those who manifest the metabolic syndrome are commonly more responsive to thiazide-type diuretic therapy. • Diuretics can be successfully combined with β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, centrally acting agents, and even calcium channel blockers. • Although thiazide-type diuretics are among the best-tolerated antihypertensive agents in terms of symptomatic adverse effects, diuretic-related adverse side effects include those with established mechanisms (eg, such as electrolyte changes and/or metabolic abnormalities) and other side effects, which are less well understood mechanistically (eg, impotence), although the latter is not universally accepted as a diuretic-related side effect. • Thiazide-induced hypokalemia is associated with increased blood glucose, and treatment of thiazide-induced hypokalemia may reverse glucose intolerance and possibly prevent diabetes. • Thiazide-induced hyperuricemia occurs as a result of volume contraction and competition with uric acid for renal tubular secretion, but does not necessarily contraindicate using a thiazide, especially if a uric acid–lowering drug such as allopurinol is being used. • Adverse interactions include the blunting of thiazide effects by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the potential to increase fatigue, lethargy, and increase in glucose when combined with β-blockers. • Thiazide-type diuretics are useful first-line agents in the treatment of hypertension because they have been proven to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in systolic and diastolic forms of hypertension and do so at low cost. • Loop diuretics should not be used as first-line therapy in hypertension since there are no outcome data with them. They should be reserved for conditions of clinically significant fluid overload (eg, heart failure and significant fluid retention with vasodilator drugs, such as minoxidil) or with advanced renal failure and can be combined with thiazide-type diuretics.},

	abstract = {The term thiazide is universally understood to refer to diuretics that exert their principal action in the distal tubule. The thiazide class is heterogenous and can be further subdivided into compounds containing the benzothiadiazine ring structure—the thiazide-type (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide)—and those lacking the benzothiadiazine ring—the thiazide-like (e.g., chlorthalidone and indapamide) drugs. Thiazide-like agents are longer acting and constitute the diuretics used in most of the cardiovascular outcome trials that established benefits of treatment with diuretics, but pragmatic aspects, such as lack of availability in convenient formulations, limit their use. Regardless of class heterogeneity, thiazides have retained importance in the management of hypertension for over 60 years. They are reliably effective as monotherapy in a majority of hypertensive patients, and augment the efficacy of other classes of antihypertensives when used in combination. Importantly, a thiazide-based treatment regimen lowers cardiovascular events, and their sturdy effect reinforces their place among the recommended first-line agents to treat hypertension in major domestic and international hypertension guidelines. There are few head-to-head comparisons within the class, but potential differences have been explored indirectly as well as in non-blood pressure mechanisms and potential pleiotropic properties. Until proven otherwise, the importance of these differences remains speculative, and clinicians should assume that cardiovascular events will be lowered similarly across agents when equivalent blood pressure reduction occurs. Thiazides remain underutilized, with only about one-third of hypertensive patients receiving them. For many patients, however, a thiazide is an indispensable component of their regimen to achieve adequate blood pressure control.},

	abstract = {Blockers of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), that is, renin inhibitors, angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Ang II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, are a cornerstone in the treatment of hypertension. How exactly they exert their effect, in particular in patients with low circulating RAAS activity, also taking into consideration the so-called Ang II/aldosterone escape that often occurs after initial blockade, is still incompletely understood. Multiple studies have tried to find parameters that predict the response to RAAS blockade, allowing a personalized treatment approach. Consequently, the question should now be answered on what basis (eg, sex, ethnicity, age, salt intake, baseline renin, ACE or aldosterone, and genetic variance) a RAAS blocker can be chosen to treat an individual patient. Are all blockers equal? Does optimal blockade imply maximum RAAS blockade, for example, by combining ≥2 RAAS blockers or by simply increasing the dose of 1 blocker? Exciting recent investigations reveal a range of unanticipated extrarenal effects of aldosterone, as well as a detailed insight in the genetic causes of primary aldosteronism, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers have now become an important treatment option for resistant hypertension. Finally, apart from the deleterious ACE-Ang II-Ang II type 1 receptor arm, animal studies support the existence of protective aminopeptidase A-Ang III-Ang II type 2 receptor and ACE2-Ang-(1 to 7)-Mas receptor arms, paving the way for multiple new treatment options. This review provides an update about all these aspects, critically discussing the many controversies and allowing the reader to obtain a full understanding of what we currently know about RAAS alterations in hypertension.},

Key Points and Practical Recommendations • Aliskiren, the sole oral renin inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, either as monotherapy or in combination, with reductions in blood pressure similar to other agents. • Early evidence suggests that aliskiren confers additional benefit in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Data are not yet available to determine whether protection will extend to cardiovascular disease. • No initial dosage adjustment is required in elderly patients or for patients with mild to severe renal impairment; however, clinical experience is limited in patients with significant renal impairment, and with renal artery stenosis. • It appears rational to combine aliskiren with agents that otherwise increase plasma renin activity, including thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. • While there is a reactive rise in renin in response to aliskiren, probably larger than that induced by angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, there is no evidence that this rise is harmful. • In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of edema anywhere in the body was 0.4\% with aliskiren compared with 0.5\% with placebo. It is unknown whether angioedema rates are higher in blacks with aliskiren. • Aliskiren is associated with a slight increase in cough, with rates of about one third to one half seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. • Increases in serum potassium {\textgreater}5.5 meq/L were infrequent in patients with essential hypertension treated with aliskiren alone (0.9\% compared with 0.6\% with placebo).},

These combinations can be given as initial therapy (where appropriate) or later in the course of treatment. Three-drug combinations (angiotensin receptor blocker plus amlodipine plus hydrochlorothiazide and angiotensin receptor blocker plus aliskiren plus hydrochlorothiazide) are also available.},

Key Points and Practical Recommendations • Calcium channel blockers, which dilate arteries by reducing calcium flux into cells, effectively lower blood pressure, especially in combination with other drugs, and some formulations of agents of this class are approved for treating angina or cardiac dysrhythmias. • Calcium channel blockers reduce blood pressure across all patient groups, regardless of sex, race/ethnicity, age, and dietary sodium intake. • Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are more negatively chronotropic and inotropic than the dihydropyridine subclass, which is important for patients with cardiac dysrhythmias or who need β-blockers. • Extensive experience in comparative randomized trials indicates that an initial calcium antagonist can prevent all major types of cardiovascular disease, except heart failure (for which a diuretic is superior). Initial dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have not reduced the rate of progression of renal disease as well as inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, although members of the nondihydropyridine subclass can reduce albuminuria. • High doses of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers often cause edema, headache, flushing and tachycardia; high doses of verapamil can cause constipation. Diltiazem and verapamil have important drug interaction with digoxin and cyclosporine, among others.},

	abstract = {In the mid 1960s, experimental work on molecules under screening as coronary dilators allowed the discovery of the mechanism of calcium entry blockade by drugs later named calcium channel blockers. This paper summarizes scientific research on these small molecules interacting directly with L-type voltage-operated calcium channels. It also reports on experimental approaches translated into understanding of their therapeutic actions. The importance of calcium in muscle contraction was discovered by Sidney Ringer who reported this fact in 1883. Interest in the intracellular role of calcium arose 60 years later out of Kamada (Japan) and Heibrunn (USA) experiments in the early 1940s. Studies on pharmacology of calcium function were initiated in the mid 1960s and their therapeutic applications globally occurred in the the 1980s. The first part of this report deals with basic pharmacology in the cardiovascular system particularly in isolated arteries. In the section entitled from calcium antagonists to calcium channel blockers, it is recalled that drugs of a series of diphenylpiperazines screened in vivo on coronary bed precontracted by angiotensin were initially named calcium antagonists on the basis of their effect in depolarized arteries contracted by calcium. Studies on arteries contracted by catecholamines showed that the vasorelaxation resulted from blockade of calcium entry. Radiochemical and electrophysiological studies performed with dihydropyridines allowed their cellular targets to be identified with L-type voltage-operated calcium channels. The modulated receptor theory helped the understanding of their variation in affinity dependent on arterial cell membrane potential and promoted the terminology calcium channel blocker (CCB) of which the various chemical families are introduced in the paper. In the section entitled tissue selectivity of CCBs, it is shown that characteristics of the drug, properties of the tissue, and of the stimuli are important factors of their action. The high sensitivity of hypertensive animals is explained by the partial depolarization of their arteries. It is noted that they are arteriolar dilators and that they cannot be simply considered as vasodilators. The second part of this report provides key information about clinical usefulness of CCBs. A section is devoted to the controversy on their safety closed by the Allhat trial (2002). Sections are dedicated to their effect in cardiac ischemia, in cardiac arrhythmias, in atherosclerosis, in hypertension, and its complications. CCBs appear as the most commonly used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. As far as hypertension is concerned, globally the prevalence in adults aged 25 years and over was around 40\% in 2008. Usefulness of CCBs is discussed on the basis of large clinical trials. At therapeutic dosage, they reduce the elevated blood pressure of hypertensive patients but don't change blood pressure of normotensive subjects, as was observed in animals. Those active on both L- and T-type channels are efficient in nephropathy. Alteration of cognitive function is a complication of hypertension recognized nowadays as eventually leading to dementia. This question is discussed together with the efficacy of CCBs in cognitive pathology. In the section entitled beyond the cardiovascular system, CCBs actions in migraine, neuropathic pain, and subarachnoid hemorrhage are reported. The final conclusions refer to long-term effects discovered in experimental animals that have not yet been clearly reported as being important in human pharmacotherapy.},

	abstract = {Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) inhibit voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels. This leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in the heart. The latter are counteracted in vivo by a vasodilatation-triggered, baroreceptor-mediated reflex increase in sympathetic tone, resulting in indirect cardiostimulation. The mean vascular/cardiac effect ratios of the first-generation CCBs-verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem-are relatively low and amount to approximately 3, 10, and 3, respectively. The pharmacokinetic properties of verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem are similar. The drugs are almost completely absorbed after oral administration, but their bioavailability is reduced because of first-pass hepatic metabolism. The onset of action of verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem, at least in immediate-release formulations, is relatively fast (0.5-2 hours), and their elimination half-lives range from 2 to 7 hours. The second-generation CCBs (e.g., amlodipine, felodipine, and nisoldipine) have a slower onset of action (due to either intrinsic properties of the drug or a slow-release formulation), a longer duration of action, and greater vascular/cardiac effect ratios. These features may provide therapeutic benefits, for example, a less pronounced increase in sympathetic tone and reflex tachycardia, and reduced likelihood of negative inotropic effects. These agents can therefore probably be used in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.},

These agents are employed in the treatment of hypertension, coronary ischemia, and/or supraventricular arrhythmias. CCBs are both substrates for, and in the instance of verapamil and diltiazem inhibitors of, cytochrome P450 3A4. In the case of verapamil and diltiazem, this inhibitory effect increases the likelihood of drug-drug interactions with other compounds similarly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Much of the debate with reference to a cardiovascular risk for CCBs has been quieted with the advent of sustained-release delivery systems that offer a more gradual rate of drug delivery. The most common side effects with CCBs are vasodilatory in nature and include peripheral edema, flushing, and headache. Despite the potential for side effects with CCBs, their potent blood pressure-lowering effect makes them a prerequisite for blood pressure control in many patients.},

	abstract = {This paper summarizes the pharmacological properties of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), their established therapeutic uses for cardiovascular disorders and the current improvement of their clinical effects through drug combinations. Their identification resulted from study of small molecules including coronary dilators, which were named calcium antagonists. Further experiments showed that they reduced contraction of arteries by inhibiting calcium entry and by interacting with binding sites identified on voltage-dependent calcium channels. This led to the denomination calcium channel blockers. In short-term studies, by decreasing total peripheral resistance, CCBs lower arterial pressure. By unloading the heart and increasing coronary blood flow, CCBs improve myocardial oxygenation. In long-term treatment, the decrease in blood pressure is more pronounced in hypertensive than in normotensive patients. A controversy on the safety of CCBs ended after a large antihypertensive trial (ALLHAT) sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. There are two main types of CCBs: dihydopyridine and non-dihydropyridine; the first type is vascular selective. Dihydropyrines are indicated for hypertension, chronic, stable and vasospastic angina. Non-dihydropyridines have the same indications plus antiarrythmic effects in atrial fibrillation or flutter and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. In addition, CCBs reduced newly formed coronary lesions in atherosclerosis. In order to reach recommended blood pressure goals, there is a recent therapeutic move by combination of CCBs with other antihypertensive agents particularly with inhibitors acting at the level of the renin-angiotensin system. They are also combined with statins. Prevention of dementia has been reported in hypertensive patients treated with nitrendipine, opening a way for further studies on CCBs? beneficial effect in cognitive deterioration associated with aging.},

	abstract = {Objective: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic properties of commonly used ?-blockers (atenolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, metoprolol tartrate, and nebivolol). Data Sources: A MEDLINE literature search (1966-May 2013) was performed using the following key terms: hypertension, ?-blockers, atenolol, carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate, metoprolol succinate, nebivolol, pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, blood pressure, metabolic, lipid, central aortic pressure, diabetes, and insulin resistance. References from publications reviewed were included. Study Selection and Data Extraction: English-language articles identified were reviewed. Animal studies and studies in patients for a primary diagnosis of coronary artery disease were excluded. Data Synthesis: ?-Blockers are no longer recommended first-line therapy for primary hypertension, based on data showing that ?-blockers are inferior to other antihypertensives and no better than placebo, in spite of provision of blood pressure reduction. Because atenolol is the ?-blocker used in 75\% of these studies, uncertainty about widespread application to all ?-blockers exists. Different pharmacological and physiological properties, both within ?-blockers and compared with other antihypertensives, may explain divergent effects. Evidence shows that ?-blockers have a truncated effect on central aortic pressure, an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, compared with other antihypertensive classes; differences within the class may exist, but the evidence is inconclusive. Metabolic effects differ within the ?-blocker class, with evidence that carvedilol causes less metabolic dysregulation. Conclusion: Emerging evidence reveals physiological differences within the ?-blocker class and in comparison to other antihypertensives. These differences provide insight into the diverse clinical effects ?-blockers provide in cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {Beta blockers have been used in the treatment of cardiovascular conditions for decades. Despite a long history and status as a guideline-recommended treatment option for hypertension, recent meta-analyses have brought into question whether β blockers are still an appropriate therapy given outcomes data from other antihypertensive drug classes. However, β blockers are a heterogenous class of agents with diverse pharmacologic and physiologic properties. Much of the unfavorable data revealed in the recent meta-analyses were gleaned from studies involving nonvasodilating, traditional β blockers, such as atenolol. However, findings with traditional β blockers may not be extrapolated to other members of the class, particularly those agents with vasodilatory activity. Vasodilatory β blockers (i.e., carvedilol and nebivolol) reduce blood pressure in large part through reducing systemic vascular resistance rather than by decreasing cardiac output, as is observed with traditional β blockers. Vasodilating ability may also ameliorate some of the concerns associated with traditional β blockade, such as the adverse effects on metabolic and lipid parameters, including an increased risk for new-onset diabetes. Furthermore, vasodilating ability is physiologically relevant and important in treating a condition with common co-morbidities involving metabolic and lipid abnormalities such as hypertension. In patients with hypertension and diabetes or coronary artery disease, vasodilating β blockers provide effective blood pressure control with neutral or beneficial effects on important parameters for the co-morbid disease. In conclusion, it is time for a reexamination of the clinical evidence for the use of β blockers in hypertension, recognizing that there are patients for whom β blockers, particularly those with vasodilatory actions, are an appropriate treatment option.},

	abstract = {Hypertension has become a large burden of global development, but the mechanisms of it have still not been well elucidated. Increased contractility of vascular smooth cells induced by the overactivity of neurohormonal system or stress is one of the main and popular explanations until now. Smoothelin-B, recognized as the actin-binding protein, is only expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and takes part in the contraction process of vascular smooth cells. Rensen et al. demonstrated that deficiency of smoothelin-B resulted in reduced contractile capacity of vascular smooth muscle and hypertension in mice, which provides us a novel fact in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Therefore, we proposed that reduced contractile capacity of vascular smooth muscle could result in hypertension, the mechanism of which might be related to normal cardiac output but blood retention induced by reduced vasoconstriction, impaired vasodilatation and decreased blood vessels. Studies are needed to demonstrate our hypotheses and further investigation and discussion should be focused on the treatment in these patients because β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker may be not suitable for them.
The common use and wide availability of beta-adrenergic blocking agents make them frequent ingestants for small children. Yet, there are no clear guidelines in the literature to direct the care of the toddler with the history of ingesting 1–2 tablets. With 40 years of extensive clinical experience, not one documented case of death or serious cardiovascular morbidity as a direct result of a beta-blocker exposure is to be found in an English language review for children under 6 years of age. As with children on chronic beta-blocker therapy, several cases of symptomatic hypoglycemia associated with a single acute propranolol exposure suggest a vulnerability to this complication. Though the risk to the toddler exposed to 1–2 tablets appears to be extremely small, several factors mitigate the actual risk to the child and the need for triage to a health care facility.
Nadolol, a nonspecific β-blocker, is a racemate composed of equal amounts of four stereoisomers, namely, SQ-12148, SQ-12149, SQ-12150, and SQ-12151. In an open-label, randomized, four-period crossover study, the pharmacokinetics of nadolol and its stereoisomers and the bioequivalence of two formulations of nadolol were assessed in 20 healthy male subjects following a single dose (80 mg) and multiple doses (80 mg; once daily for 7 days). A standard granulated tablet and direct compressed tablet formulations, each containing 80 mg of nadolol, with different in vitro dissolution profiles that met current USP requirements were used. The four treatments were single and multiple doses of granulated tablet, and single and multiple doses of compressed tablet. There was a 7 day washout period between successive treatments. All doses of nadolol were administered after an overnight fast. Serial blood samples were collected up to 72 h following the single dose and during multiple dose treatments, following day 6 and 7 doses. Validated high-performance liquid chromatographic assays were applied to measure nadolol and its stereoisomers in the study samples. Plasma concentration data were subjected to noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. Both Cmax and AUC values were significantly greater for SQ-12150 when compared to other nadolol stereoisomers obtained after a single dose or at steady state. However, Tmax and T1/2 values were similar among the four isomers. The observed steady state AUCτ values for nadolol (2278-2331 ng h/mL) or its stereoisomers (550-874 ng h/mL) were significantly greater than those predicted from the single dose AUCinf values (nadolol, 1840-1845 ng h/mL; isomers, 450-713 ng h/mL). The intrasubject variability, computed from multiple dose data, was generally greater for the stereoisomers (17-40\%) than for nadolol (10-32\%). The two formulations were bioequivalent for nadolol (Cmax= 0.98 [84\%, 117\%]; AUCinf= 103 [93\%, 116\%]) and SQ-12150 (Cmax= 1.12 [89\%, 122\%]; AUCinf= 0.98 [82\%, 119\%]) after a single dose, and only for nadolol (Cmax= 107 [84\%, 118\%]; AUCinf= 102 [91\%, 113\%]) at steady state.
The intranasal administration of drugs has long been used for the topical treatment of various nasal disorders. Many features of the intranasal mucosa also make it useful for delivery of systemically active agents. It has been shown that intranasal drug administration can provide plasma drug levels similar to those observed with comparable doses of parenteral drugs. The feasibility of intranasal administration of propranolol, nifedipine, and nitroglycerin has been investigated in several small clinical studies. Intranasal propranolol has been shown to improve exercise tolerance in patients with angina pectoris. Intranasal nifedipine has been used to treat patients with perioperative hypertension and hypertensive crisis. Intranasal administration of nitroglycerin was shown to blunt the hypertensive response to endotracheal intubation. These studies and others suggest that intranasal delivery of cardiovascular drug treatment could be used in those clinical situations where a rapid or intermittent drug effect is desired and can potentially serve as an alternative to parenteral drug administration.
We characterized the angiotensin II (AII) receptor in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). This receptor binds [125I]Sar1, lle8-angiotensin II with a high affinity of 0.20±0.04 nM and a low capacity of 5.3±0.4 fmol/mg protein (230±17 sites/cell). Based on the Ki values, the ranking order of [125I]Sar1, lle8-AII binding inhibition was as follows: Sar1, lle8-AII{\textgreater} All{\textgreater} Dup 753{\textgreater} AII{\textgreater} AI≫ PD 123319. The addition of AII to HASMCs induced a rapid, transient increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration followed by a lower, sustained phase. When extracellular Ca2+ was removed by adding 3 mM EGTA, this initial transient increase was not changed, but the sustained phase was abolished. These results revealed AII receptors in HASMCs to be of the type 1 receptor subtype, which induce Ca2+ mobilization mainly from intracellular Ca2+ stores.
The efficacy and safety of oral nadolol in supraventricular tachycardia were evaluated prospectively in 27 children (median age 5.5 years). Fifteen patients had an unsuccessful trial of digoxin therapy. Intravenous nadolol was given to seven patients during electrophysiologic study; five of these had an excellent response and two had a partial response (25\% decrease in tachycardia rate). Six of these patients had a similar response to oral nadolol. Twelve patients received both propranolol and nadolol. Among six patients, intravenous propranolol was successful in four and unsuccessful in two; all six had a similar response to oral nadolol. With oral propranolol, tachycardia was well controlled in four patients and persistent in two; five of five patients had a similar response to oral nadolol.
Twenty-six patients were treated with oral nadolol; the ar- rhythmia was well controlled in 23, 2 had recurrent tachycardia and 1 patient had tachycardia at a 25\% slower rate. The effective dose of nadolol ranged between 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg body weight once daily (median dose 1 mg/kg per day). During follow-up (3 to 36 months), compliance and tolerance were excellent; excluding 2 patients with reactive airway disease who developed wheezing, only 3 (12\%) of 24 had side effects necessitating a change in drug therapy.
Once a day nadolol is a safe and effective agent in the management of supraventricular tachycardia in children. Its long-term efficacy can be predicted by the short-term response to intravenous nadolol or propranolol during programmed electrophysiologic study.},

Key Points and Practical Recommendations • β-Blockers are appropriate treatment for patients with hypertension and those who have concomitant ischemic heart disease, heart failure, obstructive cardiomyopathy, or certain arrhythmias. • β-Blockers can be used in combination with other antihypertensive drugs to achieve maximal blood pressure control. Labetalol can be used in hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. • β-Blockers may be useful in patients having hyperkinetic circulation (palpitations, tachycardia, hypertension, and anxiety), migraine headache, and essential tremor. • β-Blockers are highly heterogeneous with respect to various pharmacologic effects: degree of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, membrane-stabilizing activity, β1 selectivity, α1-adrenergic–blocking effect, tissue solubility, routes of systemic elimination, potencies and duration of action, and specific effects may be important in the selection of a drug for clinical use. • β-Blocker usage to reduce perioperative ischemia and cardiovascular complications may not benefit as many patients as was once hoped and may actually cause harm in some individuals. Currently the best evidence supports β-blocker use in two patient groups: patients undergoing vascular surgery with known ischemic heart disease or multiple risk factors for it and for patients already receiving β-blockers for known cardiovascular conditions.},

	abstract = {Propranolol, a non-selective β-adrenergic blocking drug, was recently reported to control the growth of hemangiomas, the most common vascular tumor of infancy. However, the mechanisms involved in this effect remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that propranolol dose-dependently inhibited growth factor-induced proliferation of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) through a G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest. This was correlated to decreased cyclin D1, cyclin D3, and cyclin-dependent kinase CDK6 protein levels, while increases in the CDK inhibitors p15INK4B, p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 were observed. Chemotactic motility and differentiation of HUVECs into capillary-like tubular structures in Matrigel were also inhibited by propranolol. Furthermore, inhibition by propranolol of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-2 lead to inhibition of downstream signaling such as the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 and the secretion of the extracellular matrix degrading enzyme MMP-2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that propranolol interferes with several essential steps of neovascularization and opens up novel therapeutic opportunities for the use of β-blockers in the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent human diseases.
The management of essential hypertension has increasingly focused on the use of diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers, which lower blood pressure (BP) through effects on blood volume and on the renin-angiotensin system. However, in many individuals these agents, whether given alone or in combination, fail to normalize BP. In such cases it is likely that hypertension is at least partly maintained by pathophysiologic mechanisms other than volume and the renin-angiotensin system, and therefore, that pharmacotherapy directed at other mechanisms is needed.
One such form of hypertension is the often overlooked entity of neurogenic hypertension. The purpose of this article is to renew attention to this overlooked entity, to provide a very clinically oriented overview of its possible causes and manifestations, and to discuss the potentially important treatment implications of recognizing this form of hypertension. These implications underscore the need for further clinical and research attention concerning neurogenically mediated hypertension.
Various vanilloid-type β-adrenoceptor blockers were studied on guinea pig right atrium and trachea and rat colon. In addition, we also investigated their β1-, β2-, and β3-adrenoceptor binding affinities. All these β-adrenergic antagonists inhibited (−)isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic effects of the right atrium and tracheal relaxation responses in a concentration-dependent manner. Some of these agents prevented the inhibition of rat colon spontaneous motility by (−)isoproterenol. Of the agents tested, we found that ferulidilol, eugenodilol, eugenolol, isoeugenolol, and ferulinolol, as well as propranolol and metoprolol, possessed β3-adrenoceptor blocking activities, others were nearly without effectiveness. Furthermore, the binding characteristics of vanilloid-type β-adrenergic antagonists were evaluated in [3H]CGP-12177, a β1/β2-adrenoceptor blocker and a β3-adrenoceptor agonist, binding to β1-, β2-, and β3-adrenoceptor sites in rat ventricle, lung, and interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) membranes, respectively. Eugenodilol, eugenolol, metoprolol, isoeugenolol, and ferulinolol were less potent than both propranolol and ferulidilol in competing for the β3-adrenoceptor binding sites. From the results of in vitro functional and binding studies, we suggested that propranolol, ferulidilol, eugenodilol, eugenolol, metoprolol, isoeugenolol, and ferulinolol all possessed β3-adrenoceptor blocking activities. On the other hand, we also found that eugenodilol, eugenolol, metoprolol, isoeugenolol, and ferulinolol had a low lipid solubility in comparison with propranolol and ferulidilol. In conclusion, we proposed that β3-adrenoceptor antagonistic actions of these vanilloid-type β-blockers were positively correlated with their lipid solubility.
Betaxolol, a β1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, is widely used in the treatment of glaucoma. In addition to its ocular hypotensive effects, betaxolol has been suggested to act as a retinal neuroprotective agent (27). To investigate possible mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects, we tested the actions of betaxolol on ion channels and calcium signaling in isolated retinal ganglion cells. Betaxolol (50 μM) reduced by about 20\% the high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca channel currents in ganglion cells isolated from tiger salamander retina. In contrast, the β1-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol (10 μM) and timolol (50 μM) had no inhibitory actions on HVA Ca channel currents. The L -type Ca channel antagonist, nisoldipine, blocked the HVA Ca channel current partially and the remaining current was not inhibited by betaxolol. Outward current was inhibited in the presence of betaxolol. Both iberiotoxin (IBTX; 10 n M), a selective inhibitor of large-conductance Ca-activated K channels, and Cd2+(100 μM), which suppresses Ca-activated K channels subsequent to its block of Ca channels, reduced outward current and the remaining current was not blocked significantly with betaxolol. In the presence of betaxolol, Na channel currents were reduced by about 20\%, as were currents evoked by glutamate (10 m M) and GABA (1 m M). Current clamp recordings from isolated ganglion cells showed that betaxolol had several effects on excitability: spike height decreased, repetitive spike activity was suppressed, spike width increased and hyperpolarization following spikes was reduced. Calcium imaging in isolated rat retinal ganglion cells revealed that betaxolol inhibited glutamate-induced increases in [Ca2+]i . These results suggest that betaxolol has a diversity of suppressive actions on ganglion cell ion channels and that, as a consequence, one of the net actions of the drug is to reduce Ca2+influx. The subsequent reduction in [Ca2+]imay contribute to the apparent neuroprotective actions of betaxolol in promoting ganglion cell survival following ischemic insult, as may occur in glaucoma and retinal disease.
In the twenty years since beta-blockers were proposed for treatment of glaucoma, use of topical timolol has increased to account for 70\% of all glaucoma medications used. The objective of this article is to review the “newer” beta-blockers, and to address the generalization that “all ophthalmic beta-blockers are the same.” The review concentrates on agents that have been studied as topical treatments for patients with elevated intraocular pressure. Sections on pharmacology and design of clinical trials are included to aid the ophthalmologist in evaluating new drugs and published clinical reports. The major questions to consider in evaluating the therapeutic potential of a new beta-blocker for the treatment of glaucoma involve efficacy and safety: Is the drug as effective as timolol? Does it have a duration of action at least as long as timolol? Does it have ocular toxicity? Is it comfortable? What are its systemic effects?},

	abstract = {Alpha-adrenergic receptors play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure (BP). There are 2 principal types of α receptors, α1 and α2, and both participate in circulatory control. Alpha1 receptors are the classic postsynaptic α receptors and are found on vascular smooth muscle. They determine both arteriolar resistance and venous capacitance, and thus BP. Alpha2 receptors are found both in the brain and in the periphery. In the brain stem, they modulate sympathetic outflow. Their function in the periphery is not yet fully understood, but they may contribute both to control of sympathetic tone and to local and regional blood flow. Drugs that enhance central α2 activity, such as clonidine, guanfacine and the active metabolite of methyldopa, can significantly lower BP and are effective in the long-term control of hypertension, either alone or in combination with other drugs. While central α agonists, as a class, share a common pharmacologic mode of action, side effects, e.g., sedation and drowsiness, occur to different degrees with different drugs, and the individual agents also vary in terms of their propensity for causing withdrawal hypertension. The use of low-dose regimens or of newer drugs, such as guanfacine, with its longer half-life and duration of action, may reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions associated with this class of drugs.},

The latter may be incapacitating in some patients. Therefore, minoxidil is typically administered with both a diuretic and an agent that can control the pulse rate, such as a β blocker. Minoxidil has several other side effects that may limit its use, including hypertrichosis, aggravation of myocardial ischemia and/or left ventricular hypertrophy, and (infrequently) pericardial effusions.

However, side effect profiles and the advent of newer antihypertensive drug classes have reduced the use of these agents in recent decades. Outcome data and large randomized trials supporting the efficacy of these medications are limited; however, in general the blood pressure-lowering effect of these agents has repeatedly been shown to be comparable to other more contemporary drug classes. Nevertheless, a landmark hypertension trial found a negative outcome with a doxazosin-based regimen compared to a chlorthalidone-based regimen, leading to the removal of α-1 adrenergic receptor blockers as first-line monotherapy from the hypertension guidelines. In contemporary practice, direct vasodilators and sympatholytic agents, particularly hydralazine and clonidine, are often utilized in refractory hypertension. Hydralazine and minoxidil may also be useful alternatives for patients with renal dysfunction, and both hydralazine and methyldopa are considered first line for the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy. Hydralazine has also found widespread use for the treatment of systolic heart failure in combination with isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN). The data to support use of this combination in African Americans with heart failure are particularly robust. Hydralazine with ISDN may also serve as an alternative for patients with an intolerance to angiotensin antagonists. Given these niche indications, vasodilators and sympatholytics are still useful in clinical practice; therefore, it is prudent to understand the existing data regarding efficacy and the safe use of these medications.},

	abstract = {An activation of sympathetic neural influences to the heart and peripheral circulation has been shown to represent a hallmark of the essential hypertensive state, adrenergic neural factors participating together with other variables at the development and progression of the high blood pressure state as well as of the hypertension-related target organ damage. This represents the rationale for employing in hypertension treatment drugs which combine the blood pressure-lowering properties with the modulatory effects on the sympathetic neural function.Several studies published during the past 40 years have investigated the impact of antihypertensive drugs on the sympathetic target as assessed by indirect and direct approaches. In the present paper, the effects of different monotherapies or combination drug treatment used in hypertension to lower elevated blood pressure values on various adrenergic markers will be examined. This will be followed by a discussion of the (i) hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic consequences of employing antihypertensive drugs with sympathomodulatory or sympathoexcitatory properties and (ii) mechanisms potentially responsible for the adrenergic responses to a given antihypertensive drug. The final part of this review will address the questions still open related to the impact of antihypertensive drug treatment on sympathetic function. Two questions in particular will be examined, i.e., whether antihypertensive drugs with sympathomodulatory properties may be capable to fully restore a “normal” adrenergic drive and how far sympathetic activity should be reduced in hypertensive patients.Future investigations aimed at answering these questions will be needed in order to improve cardiovascular protection in treated hypertensive patients.},
