	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data indicate that the proportion of {US} adults with hypertension that had controlled blood pressure ({BP}) declined from 2013 to 2014 through 2017 to 2018. We analyzed data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009 to 2012, 2013 to 2016, and 2017 to 2020 to confirm this finding.
{METHODS}: Hypertension was defined as systolic {BP} ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic {BP} ≥90 mm Hg or antihypertensive medication use. {BP} control among those with hypertension was defined as systolic {BP} {\textless}140 mm Hg and diastolic {BP} {\textless}90 mm Hg.
{RESULTS}: The age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension was 31.5\% (95\% {CI}, 30.3\%-32.8\%), 32.0\% (95\% {CI}, 30.6\%-33.3\%), and 32.9\% (95\% {CI}, 31.0\%-34.7\%) in 2009 to 2012, 2013 to 2016, and 2017 to 2020, respectively (P trend=0.218). The age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension increased among non-Hispanic Asian adults from 27.0\% in 2011 to 2012 to 33.5\% in 2017 to 2020 (P trend=0.003). Among Hispanic adults, the age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension increased from 29.4\% in 2009 to 2012 to 33.2\% in 2017 to 2020 (P trend=0.029). In 2009 to 2012, 2013 to 2016, and 2017 to 2020, 52.8\% (95\% {CI}, 50.0\%-55.7\%), 51.3\% (95\% {CI}, 47.9\%-54.6\%), and 48.2\% (95\% {CI}, 45.7\%-50.8\%) of {US} adults with hypertension had controlled {BP} (P trend=0.034). Among {US} adults taking antihypertensive medication, 69.9\% (95\% {CI}, 67.8\%-72.0\%), 69.3\% (95\% {CI}, 66.6\%-71.9\%), and 67.7\% (95\% {CI}, 65.2\%-70.3\%) had controlled {BP} in 2009 to 2012, 2013 to 2016, and 2017 to 2020, respectively (P trend=0.189). Among all {US} adults with hypertension and those taking antihypertensive medication, a decline in {BP} control between 2009 to 2012 and 2017 to 2020 occurred among those ≥75 years, women, and non-Hispanic black adults.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These data confirm that the proportion of {US} adults with hypertension who have controlled {BP} has declined.},

	volume = {43},
	issn = {1879-114X},
	doi = {10.1016/j.clinthera.2021.01.013},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Antihypertensive agents are frequently prescribed in kidney transplant recipients ({KTRs}). However, the frequency and patterns of prescribing antihypertensive agents remain uncharacterized in {KTRs} in China. Therefore, this investigation was carried out.
{METHODS}: Retrospective prescription data dated 2011 to 2018 from {KTRs} in China were accessed using the Hospital Prescription Analysis Program database. Information about sex, birth date, and identification number of the patient; city, date, and department of the medical visit; major diagnoses; and the generic names, specifications, quantities, and usage of prescribed drugs were collected. Antihypertensive agents were grouped into 5 classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ({ACEIs}), angiotensin receptor blockers ({ARBs}), β-blockers ({BBs}), calcium channel blockers ({CCBs}), and diuretics. The frequency and patterns of prescribing these antihypertensive agents were analyzed.
{FINDINGS}: Prescriptions from 174,749 {KTRs} (67.2\% male; mean age, 42.5 [9.4] years) were obtained, and 58.2\% of the patients were prescribed antihypertensive agents. The percentage of patients who received antihypertensive treatment increased from 52.9\% in 2011 to 61.6\% in 2018 and varied by city. Cyclosporine was associated with higher prescription frequency of antihypertensive agents than was tacrolimus (71.7\% vs 63.4\%; P {\textless} 0.0001). During the 8-year study period, {CCBs} were most frequently prescribed (39.0\%), followed by {ARBs} (31.9\%), {BBs} (14.3\%), {ACEIs} (11.6\%), and diuretics (3.2\%). The mean ({SD}) number of antihypertensive drugs prescribed per {KTR} was 1.7 (0.8). Almost half of {KTRs} (51.2\%) received just 1 antihypertensive drug. Co-administration of 2 or more antihypertensive drugs presented an obviously upward trend. The most commonly prescribed 2-drug combination was {CCB} + {ARB} (44.8\%), followed by {CCB} + {BB} (20.1\%) and {CCB} + {ACEI} (13.0\%). In the patients who received 3 antihypertensive drugs, the 2 most frequently prescribed combinations were {CCB} + {ARB} + {BB} (37.5\%) and {CCB} + {ARB} + {ACEI} (32.7\%). Specific data varied by both year and city.
{IMPLICATIONS}: The prescribing patterns of antihypertensive agents in {KTRs} varied by city even within same country. Hence, more high-quality research studies on the use of antihypertensive agents in {KTRs} are needed.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Diabetes and hypertension are the 2 leading risk factors for suboptimal cardiovascular and renal outcomes. These 2 conditions often coexist and can benefit from antihypertensive therapy, which may lead to blood pressure control and reduced risk for nephropathy (as evidenced by albuminuria).
{OBJECTIVE}: To quantify the trends of antihypertensive drug use and to assess the impact of antihypertensive treatment on the prevalence of blood pressure control and albuminuria, among {US} adults with coexisting diabetes and hypertension.
{METHODS}: In this serial cross-sectional study, we analyzed data from the 1999-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 3586). We determine the prevalence of antihypertensive use, drug classes used, and their association with blood pressure control and albuminuria.
{RESULTS}: During the study period, the study population experienced substantial increase in antihypertensive treatment (from 84.6\% in 1999-2002 to 90.1\% in 2011-2014, Ptrend  {\textless} .01) and blood pressure control (from 37.1\% to 46.9\%, Ptrend  {\textless} .01) and decrease in albuminuria (from 39.1\% to 31.3\%, Ptrend  = .02). These trends were particularly pronounced in the subgroups using angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin {II} receptor blockers. In multivariate analysis, Blacks, Hispanics, and males were found more likely to have albuminuria than their respective counterparts. Achieving blood pressure control (odds ratio = 0.40, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 0.32-0.49) was associated with lower rates of albuminuria.
{CONCLUSION} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: Despite continued improvement in antihypertensive therapy, the burden of uncontrolled blood pressure and albuminuria remains substantial among {US} adults with diabetes and hypertension. Tailoring pharmacotherapy based on patient characteristics and comorbidities is needed to further improve these outcomes.},

We aimed at evaluating racial differences in antihypertensive drug utilization patterns and blood pressure control by insurance status, age, sex, and presence of comorbidities.
{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: A total of 8796 hypertensive individuals ≥18 years of age were identified from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2012) in a repeated cross-sectional study. During the study period, all 3 racial groups (whites, blacks, and Hispanics) experienced substantial increase in hypertension treatment and control. The overall treatment rates were 73.9\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 71.6\%-76.2\%), 70.8\% (95\% {CI}, 68.6\%-73.0\%), and 60.7\% (95\% {CI}, 57.0\%-64.3\%) and hypertension control rates were 42.9\% (95\% {CI}, 40.5\%-45.2\%), 36.9\% (95\% {CI}, 34.7\%-39.2\%), and 31.2\% (95\% {CI}, 28.6\%-33.9\%) for whites, blacks, and Hispanics, respectively. When stratified by insurance status, blacks (odds ratio, 0.74 [95\% {CI}, 0.64-0.86] for insured and 0.59 [95\% {CI}, 0.36-0.94] for uninsured) and Hispanics (odds ratio, 0.74 [95\% {CI}, 0.60-0.91] for insured and 0.58 [95\% {CI}, 0.36-0.94] for uninsured) persistently had lower rates of hypertension control compared with whites. Racial disparities also persisted in subgroups stratified by age (≥60 and {\textless}60 years of age) and presence of comorbidities but worsened among patients {\textless}60 years of age.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Black and Hispanic patients had poorer hypertension control compared with whites, and these differences were more pronounced in younger and uninsured patients. Although black patients received more intensive antihypertensive therapy, Hispanics were undertreated. Future studies should further explore all aspects of these disparities to improve cardiovascular outcomes.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0119292},
	abstract = {{IMPORTANCE}: Hypertension is common and costly. Over the past decade, new antihypertensive therapies have been developed, several have lost patent protection and additional evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of these agents has accrued.
{OBJECTIVE}: To examine trends in the use of antihypertensive therapies in the United States between 1997 and 2012.
{DESIGN}, {SETTING} {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: We used nationally representative audit data from the {IMS} Health National Disease and Therapeutic Index to examine the ambulatory pharmacologic treatment of hypertension.
{OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Our primary unit of analysis was a visit where hypertension was a reported diagnosis and treated with a pharmacotherapy (treatment visit). We restricted analyses to the use of six therapeutic classes of antihypertensive medications among individuals 18 years or older.
{RESULTS}: Annual hypertension treatment visits increased from 56.9 million treatment visits (95\% confidence intervals [{CI}], 53.9-59.8) in 1997 to 83.3 million visits ({CI} 79.2-87.3) in 2008, then declined steadily to 70.9 million visits ({CI} 66.7-75.0) by 2012. Angiotensin receptor blocker utilization increased substantially from 3\% of treatment visits in 1997 to 18\% by 2012, whereas calcium channel blocker use decreased from 27\% to 18\% of visits. Rates of diuretic and beta-blocker use remained stable and represented 24\%-30\% and 14-16\% of visits, respectively. Use of direct renin inhibitor accounted for fewer than 2\% of annual visits. The proportion of visits treated using fixed-dose combination therapies increased from 28\% to 37\% of visits.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Several important changes have occurred in the landscape of antihypertensive treatment in the United States during the past decade. Despite their novel mechanism of action, the adoption rate of direct renin inhibitors remains low.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recent guidelines recommended different approaches to hypertension therapy. Our aim was to evaluate trends in blood pressure ({BP}) management among patients admitted with acute stroke over the past decade.
{METHODS}: The study population comprised 6279 consecutive patients, admitted with an acute stroke, and included in a national registry of three consecutive periods conducted during the years 2004-2010. We compared patients' characteristics and temporal trends of antihypertensive therapy utilization before hospital admission.
{RESULTS}: Among 4727 hypertensive patients, 3940 (83\%) patients have taken antihypertensive drug therapy - 1430 (30.2\%) a single agent, 1500 (31.7\%) two agents and 1010 (21.4\%) three or more antihypertensive agents. The most common class used was renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}) blockers (n = 2575; 54\%) followed by beta-blockers (n = 2033; 43\%). The same pattern was observed in patients treated with monotherapy. The use of {RAS} blockers and beta-blockers has increased over the years (p {\textless} 0.001 for both), whereas the use of diuretics decreased and the use of calcium antagonists remained stable. Among those who were treated with a single agent, the use of diuretics and calcium antagonists decreased and the use of {RAS} blockers increased, whereas the use of beta-blockers remained unchanged.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {RAS} blockers and beta-blockers are the most common antihypertensive agents used in Israel. Over time, the use of {RAS} blockers and beta-blockers has increased, whereas the use of diuretics decreased.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Blood pressure ({BP}) control in China is generally poor. It is assumed that an important cause of this unsatisfactory situation is the present standard of care provided by primary care physicians.
{METHODS}: One thousand community health centers ({CHCs}) were selected across China based on geographical location, previous cooperative experience, and acceptance of an invitation to implement a standardized protocol of community-based {BP} management. Baseline information for each hypertensive patient under the care of these {CHCs} was collected, and the present pattern of hypertensive drug treatment was analyzed.
{RESULTS}: Of all identified hypertensive patients (n = 249,830), 37\% were treated with drugs. Characteristics linked with hypertension treatment included systolic {BP}, age, sex, region, smoking and alcohol consumption status, body mass index, comorbidities, and family history. The most frequently prescribed classes of antihypertensive drugs were diuretics (56.0\%), followed by centrally active drugs ({CADs}) (38.3\%), calcium channel blockers ({CCBs}) (36.8\%), vasodilators (26.5\%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ({ACEIs}) (23.3\%). In regards to drug combination patterns, diuretics plus {CADs} was the most frequently used 2-drug combination (61.4\%) and vasodilators plus {CADs} plus diuretics was the most frequently used 3-drug therapy (69.2\%). Seventy-seven percent of patients on combination therapy were prescribed single pill combinations, 87.2\% of which were composed of {CADs} and vasodilators and 12.8\% of which were composed of {ACEIs} and diuretics. The control rates of patients on monotherapy and combination therapy were 27.7\% and 24.1\% (P {\textless} 0.05), respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our study identified major shortcomings in the present status of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy in routine medical practice in China. It is essential to implement a program of professional education regarding the appropriate use of antihypertensive drugs.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To assess the impact of early hypertension ({HT}) control on occurrence of subsequent major cardiovascular events in those with diabetes and recent-onset {HT}.
{RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: Study subjects were 15,665 adults with diabetes but no diagnosed coronary or cerebrovascular disease at baseline who met standard criteria for new-onset {HT}. Poisson regression models assessed whether adequate blood pressure control within 1 year of {HT} onset predicts subsequent occurrence of major cardiovascular events with and without adjustment for baseline Framingham Risk Score ({FRS}) and other covariates.
{RESULTS}: Mean age was 51.5 years, and mean blood pressure at {HT} onset was 136.8/80.8 {mmHg}. In the year after {HT} onset, mean blood pressure decreased to 131.4/78.0 {mmHg} and was {\textless}130/80 {mmHg} in 32.9\% of subjects and {\textless}140/90 {mmHg} in 80.2\%.

	abstract = {As a consequence of the aging population and the increasing prevalence rates for conditions such as type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease ({CKD}), management of hypertension will be focusing more and more on the high-risk patient. Clinical practice guidelines for managing hypertension in the United States recommend a target blood pressure ({BP}) {\textless}130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes or {CKD}, notably lower than the 140/90-mm Hg threshold for the general hypertensive population. However, the optimal timeframe from initiation of antihypertensive therapy to attaining these levels of {BP} control and influencing cardiovascular outcomes is not as well defined. Overall, a series of landmark {BP} intervention trials in patients with hypertension and additional cardiovascular risk factors collectively support that achieving prompt {BP} control, ideally within 1-3 months, translates into improved cardiovascular outcomes. Although the consistency of the findings is encouraging, the strength of this conclusion is limited by the available data, which were derived from studies not designed to determine the definition or benefits of early {BP} reduction. In several of these studies, using a treatment approach with initial monotherapy or combination therapy has clearly demonstrated pronounced {BP} lowering and high {BP} control rates within an intensive timeframe of 3-6 months of therapy. Although these studies were not conducted exclusively in high-risk patients, subgroup analyses have demonstrated that the observed outcomes in the overall study populations apply to the diabetic and {CKD} subsets.},

However, in medical research, many baseline covariates are dichotomous. In this article, we explore the utility and interpretation of the standardized difference for comparing the prevalence of dichotomous variables between two groups. We examined the relationship between the standardized difference, and the maximal difference in the prevalence of the binary variable between two groups, the relative risk relating the prevalence of the binary variable in one group compared to the prevalence in the other group, and the phi coefficient for measuring correlation between the treatment group and the binary variable. We found that a standardized difference of 10\% (or 0.1) is equivalent to having a phi coefficient of 0.05 (indicating negligible correlation) for the correlation between treatment group and the binary variable.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11606-022-07612-3},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In 2014, hypertension guidelines for older adults endorsed increased use of fixed-dose combinations, prioritized thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers ({CCBs}) for Black patients, and no longer recommend beta-blockers as first-line therapy.
{OBJECTIVE}: To evaluate older adults' antihypertensive use following guideline changes.
{DESIGN}: Time series analysis.
{PATIENTS}: Twenty percent national sample of Medicare Part D beneficiaries aged 66 years and older with hypertension.
{INTERVENTION}: Eighth Joint National Committee ({JNC}8) guidelines {MAIN} {MEASURES}: Quarterly trends in prevalent and initial antihypertensive use were examined before (2008 to 2013) and after (2014 to 2017) {JNC}8. Analyses were conducted among all beneficiaries with hypertension, beneficiaries without chronic conditions that might influence antihypertensive selection (hypertension-only cohort), and among Black patients, given race-based guideline recommendations.
{KEY} {RESULTS}: The number of beneficiaries with hypertension increased from 1,978,494 in 2008 to 2,809,680 in 2017, the proportions using antihypertensives increased from 80.3 to 81.2\%, and the proportion using multiple classes and fixed-dose combinations declined (60.8 to 58.1\% and 20.7 to 15.1\%, respectively, all P{\textless}.01). Prior to {JNC}8, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and {CCBs} was increasing. Use of {CCBs} as initial therapy increased more rapidly following {JNC}8 (relative change in quarterly trend 0.15\% [95\% {CI}, 0.13-0.18\%), especially among Black beneficiaries (relative change 0.44\% [95\% {CI}, 0.21-0.68\%]). Contrary to guidelines, the use of thiazides and combinations as initial therapy consistently decreased in the hypertension-only cohort (13.8 to 8.3\% and 25.1 to 15.7\% respectively). By 2017, 65.9\% of Black patients in the hypertension-only cohort were initiated on recommended first-line or combination therapy compared to 80.3\% of non-Black patients.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Many older adults, particularly Black patients, continue to be initiated on antihypertensive classes not recommended as first-line, indicating opportunities to improve the effectiveness and equity of hypertension care and potentially reduce antihypertensive regimen complexity.},

	shorttitle = {Comprehensive comparative effectiveness and safety of first-line antihypertensive drug classes},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Uncertainty remains about the optimal monotherapy for hypertension, with current guidelines recommending any primary agent among the first-line drug classes thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, in the absence of comorbid indications. Randomised trials have not further refined this choice.
{METHODS}: We developed a comprehensive framework for real-world evidence that enables comparative effectiveness and safety evaluation across many drugs and outcomes from observational data encompassing millions of patients, while minimising inherent bias. Using this framework, we did a systematic, large-scale study under a new-user cohort design to estimate the relative risks of three primary (acute myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for heart failure, and stroke) and six secondary effectiveness and 46 safety outcomes comparing all first-line classes across a global network of six administrative claims and three electronic health record databases. The framework addressed residual confounding, publication bias, and p-hacking using large-scale propensity adjustment, a large set of control outcomes, and full disclosure of hypotheses tested.
{FINDINGS}: Using 4·9 million patients, we generated 22 000 calibrated, propensity-score-adjusted hazard ratios ({HRs}) comparing all classes and outcomes across databases. Most estimates revealed no effectiveness differences between classes; however, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics showed better primary effectiveness than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: acute myocardial infarction ({HR} 0·84, 95\% {CI} 0·75-0·95), hospitalisation for heart failure (0·83, 0·74-0·95), and stroke (0·83, 0·74-0·95) risk while on initial treatment. Safety profiles also favoured thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers were significantly inferior to the other four classes.
{INTERPRETATION}: This comprehensive framework introduces a new way of doing observational health-care science at scale. The approach supports equivalence between drug classes for initiating monotherapy for hypertension-in keeping with current guidelines, with the exception of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics superiority to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the inferiority of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: Meta-analysis of randomized trials identified using {PubMed}, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials searches from January 1, 1980, through April 13, 2015, of {ACEis} and {ARBs} compared with placebo or active controls and corroborated with head-to-head trials of {ARBs} vs {ACEis}. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction ({MI}), angina, stroke, heart failure, revascularization, and new-onset diabetes.
{RESULTS}: Our search yielded 106 randomized trials that enrolled 254,301 patients. Compared with placebo, {ACEis} but not {ARBs} reduced the outcomes of all-cause mortality ({ACEis} vs placebo: relative risk [{RR}], 0.89; 95\% {CI}, 0.80-1.00; {ARBs} vs placebo: {RR}, 1.01; 95\% {CI}, 0.96-1.06; Pinteraction=.04), cardiovascular death ({RR}, 0.83; 95\% {CI}, 0.70-0.99 and {RR}, 1.02; 95\% {CI}, 0.92-1.14; Pinteraction=.05), and {MI} ({RR}, 0.83; 95\% {CI}, 0.78-0.90 and {RR}, 0.93; 95\% {CI}, 0.85-1.03; Pinteraction=.06). The meta-regression analysis revealed that the difference between {ACEis} and {ARBs} compared with placebo was due to a higher placebo event rate in the {ACEis} trials (most of these trials were conducted a decade earlier than the {ARB} trials) for the outcome of all-cause mortality (P=.001), cardiovascular death (P{\textless}.001), and {MI} (P=.02). Sensitivity analyses restricted to trials published after 2000 revealed similar outcomes with {ACEis} vs placebo and {ARBs} vs placebo (Pinteraction{\textgreater}.05). Head-to-head comparison trials of {ARBs} vs {ACEis} exhibited no difference in outcomes except for a lower risk of drug withdrawal due to adverse effects with {ARBs} ({RR}, 0.72; 95\% {CI}, 0.65-0.81).
{CONCLUSION}: In patients without heart failure, evidence from placebo-controlled trials (restricted to trials after 2000), active controlled trials, and head-to-head randomized trials all suggest {ARBs} to be as efficacious and safe as {ACEis}, with the added advantage of better tolerability.},

{METHODS}: All initial users of antihypertensive drugs in 2005 and 2009 registered in the Norwegian Prescription Database were included. Treatment on five index dates at 1-year intervals was recorded. A patient was considered to be under treatment on an index date if a drug had been dispensed within the previous 180 days and to have maintained treatment persistence if he/she was on any antihypertensive treatment on the index date and all previous index dates.
{RESULTS}: Among 78,453 new users of antihypertensives in 2005, women started more often with {TZs} than men (30 vs. 25 \%) and less often with {ARBs} (22 vs. 25 \%). In men, the hazard of non-persistence with antihypertensive treatment was significantly lower among initial {ARB} users than among {TZ} users (hazard ratio 0.87, 95 \% confidence interval 0.81-0.94); in women no significant difference was found. After 4 years, 49 \% of the men and 51 \% of the women who had started with plain {TZs} were still using {TZs}, whereas 65 \% of the male {ARB} users and 60 \% of the female {ARB} users were still using {ARBs}.
{CONCLUSION}: {TZs} and {ARBs} were the most widely used first-line antihypertensives. Among the men enrolled in the study, {ARB} users had a somewhat better persistence with antihypertensive treatment than {TZ} users. Among both genders, continuation on {ARBs} was more common than continuation on {TZs}.},

	doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa0806182},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The optimal combination drug therapy for hypertension is not established, although current U.S. guidelines recommend inclusion of a diuretic. We hypothesized that treatment with the combination of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitor and a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker would be more effective in reducing the rate of cardiovascular events than treatment with an {ACE} inhibitor plus a thiazide diuretic.
{METHODS}: In a randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 11,506 patients with hypertension who were at high risk for cardiovascular events to receive treatment with either benazepril plus amlodipine or benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide. The primary end point was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for angina, resuscitation after sudden cardiac arrest, and coronary revascularization.
{RESULTS}: The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. The trial was terminated early after a mean follow-up of 36 months, when the boundary of the prespecified stopping rule was exceeded. Mean blood pressures after dose adjustment were 131.6/73.3 mm Hg in the benazepril-amlodipine group and 132.5/74.4 mm Hg in the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group. There were 552 primary-outcome events in the benazepril-amlodipine group (9.6\%) and 679 in the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group (11.8\%), representing an absolute risk reduction with benazepril-amlodipine therapy of 2.2\% and a relative risk reduction of 19.6\% (hazard ratio, 0.80, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.72 to 0.90; P{\textless}0.001). For the secondary end point of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the hazard ratio was 0.79 (95\% {CI}, 0.67 to 0.92; P=0.002). Rates of adverse events were consistent with those observed from clinical experience with the study drugs.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The benazepril-amlodipine combination was superior to the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide combination in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension who were at high risk for such events. ({ClinicalTrials}.gov number, {NCT}00170950.)},

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD002003.pub5},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Beta-blockers refer to a mixed group of drugs with diverse pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. They have shown long-term beneficial effects on mortality and cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) when used in people with heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first-line therapy for hypertension. However, the benefit of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension without compelling indications is controversial. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review initially published in 2007 and updated in 2012.
{OBJECTIVES}: To assess the effects of beta-blockers on morbidity and mortality endpoints in adults with hypertension.
{SEARCH} {METHODS}: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to June 2016: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ({CENTRAL}) (2016, Issue 6), {MEDLINE} (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and {ClinicalTrials}.gov. We checked reference lists of relevant reviews, and reference lists of studies potentially eligible for inclusion in this review, and also searched the the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 06 July 2015.
{SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: Randomised controlled trials ({RCTs}) of at least one year of duration, which assessed the effects of beta-blockers compared to placebo or other drugs, as first-line therapy for hypertension, on mortality and morbidity in adults.
{DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: We selected studies and extracted data in duplicate, resolving discrepancies by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios ({RR}) with 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) and conducted fixed-effect or random-effects meta-analyses, as appropriate. We also used {GRADE} to assess the certainty of the evidence. {GRADE} classifies the certainty of evidence as high (if we are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect), moderate (if the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect), low (if the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect), and very low (if we are very uncertain about the estimate of effect).
{MAIN} {RESULTS}: Thirteen {RCTs} met inclusion criteria. They compared beta-blockers to placebo (4 {RCTs}, 23,613 participants), diuretics (5 {RCTs}, 18,241 participants), calcium-channel blockers ({CCBs}: 4 {RCTs}, 44,825 participants), and renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}) inhibitors (3 {RCTs}, 10,828 participants). These {RCTs} were conducted between the 1970s and 2000s and most of them had a high risk of bias resulting from limitations in study design, conduct, and data analysis. There were 40,245 participants taking beta-blockers, three-quarters of them taking atenolol. We found no outcome trials involving the newer vasodilating beta-blockers (e.g. nebivolol).There was no difference in all-cause mortality between beta-blockers and placebo ({RR} 0.99, 95\% {CI} 0.88 to 1.11), diuretics or {RAS} inhibitors, but it was higher for beta-blockers compared to {CCBs} ({RR} 1.07, 95\% {CI} 1.00 to 1.14). The evidence on mortality was of moderate-certainty for all comparisons.Total {CVD} was lower for beta-blockers compared to placebo ({RR} 0.88, 95\% {CI} 0.79 to 0.97; low-certainty evidence), a reflection of the decrease in stroke ({RR} 0.80, 95\% {CI} 0.66 to 0.96; low-certainty evidence) since there was no difference in coronary heart disease ({CHD}: {RR} 0.93, 95\% {CI} 0.81 to 1.07; moderate-certainty evidence). The effect of beta-blockers on {CVD} was worse than that of {CCBs} ({RR} 1.18, 95\% {CI} 1.08 to 1.29; moderate-certainty evidence), but was not different from that of diuretics (moderate-certainty) or {RAS} inhibitors (low-certainty). In addition, there was an increase in stroke in beta-blockers compared to {CCBs} ({RR} 1.24, 95\% {CI} 1.11 to 1.40; moderate-certainty evidence) and {RAS} inhibitors ({RR} 1.30, 95\% {CI} 1.11 to 1.53; moderate-certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference in {CHD} between beta-blockers and diuretics (low-certainty evidence), {CCBs} (moderate-certainty evidence) or {RAS} inhibitors (low-certainty evidence). In the single trial involving participants aged 65 years and older, atenolol was associated with an increased {CHD} incidence compared to diuretics ({RR} 1.63, 95\% {CI} 1.15 to 2.32). Participants taking beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events than participants taking {RAS} inhibitors ({RR} 1.41, 95\% {CI} 1.29 to 1.54; moderate-certainty evidence), but there was little or no difference with placebo, diuretics or {CCBs} (low-certainty evidence).
{AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Most outcome {RCTs} on beta-blockers as initial therapy for hypertension have high risk of bias. Atenolol was the beta-blocker most used. Current evidence suggests that initiating treatment of hypertension with beta-blockers leads to modest {CVD} reductions and little or no effects on mortality. These beta-blocker effects are inferior to those of other antihypertensive drugs. Further research should be of high quality and should explore whether there are differences between different subtypes of beta-blockers or whether beta-blockers have differential effects on younger and older people.},

	abstract = {{IMPORTANCE}: Black patients with hypertension often have the lowest rates of blood pressure ({BP}) control in clinical settings. It is unknown to what extent variation in health care processes explains this disparity.
{OBJECTIVE}: To assess whether and to what extent treatment intensification, scheduled follow-up interval, and missed visits are associated with racial and ethnic disparities in {BP} control.
{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: In this cohort study, nested logistic regression models were used to estimate the likelihood of {BP} control (defined as a systolic {BP} [{SBP}] level {\textless}140 mm Hg) by race and ethnicity, and a structural equation model was used to assess the association of treatment intensification, scheduled follow-up interval, and missed visits with racial and ethnic disparities in {BP} control. The study included 16 114 adults aged 20 years or older with hypertension and elevated {BP} (defined as an {SBP} level ≥140 mm Hg) during at least 1 clinic visit between January 1, 2015, and November 15, 2017. A total of 11 safety-net clinics within the San Francisco Health Network participated in the study. Data were analyzed from November 2019 to October 2020.
{MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: Blood pressure control was assessed using the patient's most recent {BP} measurement as of November 15, 2017. Treatment intensification was calculated using the standard-based method, scored on a scale from -1.0 to 1.0, with -1.0 being the least amount of intensification and 1.0 being the most. Scheduled follow-up interval was defined as the mean number of days to the next scheduled visit after an elevated {BP} measurement. Missed visits measured the number of patients who did not show up for visits during the 4 weeks after an elevated {BP} measurement.
{RESULTS}: Among 16 114 adults with hypertension, the mean ({SD}) age was 58.6 (12.1) years, and 8098 patients (50.3\%) were female. A total of 4658 patients (28.9\%) were Asian, 3743 (23.2\%) were Black, 3694 (22.9\%) were Latinx, 2906 (18.0\%) were White, and 1113 (6.9\%) were of other races or ethnicities (including American Indian or Alaska Native [77 patients (0.4\%)], Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander [217 patients (1.3\%)], and unknown [819 patients (5.1\%)]). Compared with patients from all racial and ethnic groups, Black patients had lower treatment intensification scores (mean [{SD}], -0.33 [0.26] vs -0.29 [0.25]; β = -0.03, P {\textless} .001) and missed more visits (mean [{SD}], 0.8 [1.5] visits vs 0.4 [1.1] visits; β = 0.35; P {\textless} .001). In contrast, Asian patients had higher treatment intensification scores (mean [{SD}], -0.26 [0.23]; β = 0.02; P {\textless} .001) and fewer missed visits (mean [{SD}], 0.2 [0.7] visits; β = -0.20; P {\textless} .001). Black patients were less likely (odds ratio [{OR}], 0.82; 95\% {CI}, 0.75-0.89; P {\textless} .001) and Asian patients were more likely ({OR}, 1.13; 95\% {CI}, 1.02-1.25; P {\textless} .001) to achieve {BP} control than patients from all racial or ethnic groups. Treatment intensification and missed visits accounted for 21\% and 14\%, respectively, of the total difference in {BP} control among Black patients and 26\% and 13\% of the difference among Asian patients.
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: This study's findings suggest that racial and ethnic inequities in treatment intensification may be associated with more than 20\% of observed racial or ethnic disparities in {BP} control, and racial and ethnic differences in visit attendance may also play a role. Ensuring more equitable provision of treatment intensification could be a beneficial health care strategy to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in {BP} control.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: To examine current patterns of hypertension ({HTN}) treatment in the United States, including blood pressure ({BP}) control, prevalence of different antihypertensive agents, and variations in treatment associated with patient and physician characteristics.
{METHODS}: We used data from the National Disease and Therapeutic Index ({NDTI}), a nationally representative physician survey produced by {QuintilesIMS}. We selected patients with a diagnosis of {HTN} and identified those prescribed antihypertensive therapies. We analyzed the type of antihypertensive agents prescribed. Extent of {BP} control, and associated patient and physician characteristics. We calculated 95\% confidence intervals that accounted for the multistage {NDTI} sampling design.
{RESULTS}: Among those treated for {HTN} in 2014, {BP} control varied: systolic {BP} ({SBP}) ≥160 (15\%) vs. {SBP} 150-159 (9\%) vs. {SBP} 140-149 (19\%) vs. {SBP} 130-139 (26\%) vs. {SBP} {\textless}130 (32\%). Of those treated for {HTN}, 29\% used of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ({ACEIs}); 24\%, thiazide-like diuretics; 22\%, angiotensin receptor blockers ({ARBs}), 21\%, calcium-channel blockers ({CCBs}); and 19\% beta-blockers. Newer drugs had very limited uptake; no drugs approved after 2002 were used in more than 5\% of patients. Selection of agents varied only modestly by patient and physician characteristics.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The treatment of {HTN} in 2014 predominantly involved older medications in 5 major classes of drugs: {ACEIs}, thiazide diuretics, {ARBs}, {CCBs}, and beta-blockers. Selection of antihypertensive agents showed limited variation by age, gender, race, and insurance type. Although 58\% of treated patients had {SBP} {\textless}140, 24\% had poorly controlled {HTN} with {SBP} ≥150, indicating the need for improved treatment.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Evidence-based and age-appropriate antihypertensive pharmacotherapy in outpatient settings is essential for optimal treatment outcomes. Recent guidelines, although controversial, recommended different blood pressure goals using age cutoff of 60 years. We describe recent age-specific national trends in antihypertensive prescribing patterns and blood pressure control in {US} office-based practices.
{METHODS}: We analyzed all hypertension-related visits to physician offices from the latest available National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2003-2010). We identified trends of antihypertensive prescribing overall and by class, trends of hypertension control, age differences in antihypertensive prescribing patterns and hypertension control, predicted probabilities of hypertension control in subgroups, and correlates of hypertension control.
{RESULTS}: There were 16,729 physician office visits included in the analysis. Overall, the prescription of antihypertensive medication increased from 69.2\% in 2003-2004 to 78.8\% in 2009-2010 (Ptrend = .001), and the increased trend was consistent in both age groups ({\textless}60 and ≥60 years). This was accompanied by an improvement in the overall hypertension control (from 39.1\% to 48.8\%, Ptrend {\textless}.001). Antihypertensive prescribing patterns differ significantly between the 2 age groups. The proportions of visits with β-blocker (from 25.4\% to 34.7\%, Ptrend {\textless}.001) and angiotensin receptor blocker prescriptions (from 17.0\% to 22.1\%, Ptrend = .042) increased for older patients. The increased trend of β-blocker use persisted after excluding patients with compelling indications. Among treated patients, lower odds of blood pressure control were associated with African American race, presence of comorbidities, younger age, and insufficient insurance coverage.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In office-based practices, antihypertensive medication prescribing among {US} adults with hypertension increased significantly in recent years, which was accompanied by improvement in hypertension control. The prescribing patterns differed among younger and older patients, but continuous use of β-blockers without other compelling indications raises concerns.},

Identifying factors associated with monotherapy use despite uncontrolled blood pressure ({BP}) overall and within race/ethnic groups may elucidate intervention targets in under-treated populations.
{METHODS}: Cross-sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys ({NHANES}; 2013-2014 through 2017-2018). We included participants age ≥20 years with hypertension, taking at least one antihypertensive medication, and uncontrolled {BP} (systolic {BP} [{SBP}] ≥ 140 {mmHg} or diastolic {BP} [{DBP}] ≥ 90 {mmHg}). Demographic, clinical, and healthcare-access factors associated with antihypertensive monotherapy were determined using multivariable-adjusted Poisson regression.
{RESULTS}: Among 1,597 participants with hypertension and uncontrolled {BP}, age- and sex- adjusted prevalence of monotherapy was 42.6\% overall, 45.4\% among non-Hispanic White, 31.9\% among non-Hispanic Black, 39.6\% among Hispanic, and 50.9\% among non-Hispanic Asian adults. Overall, higher {SBP} was associated with higher monotherapy use, while older age, having a healthcare visit in the previous year, higher body mass index, and having heart failure were associated with lower monotherapy use.

Many adults require 2 or more classes of antihypertensive medication to achieve guideline-recommended {BP} goals, but the proportion of {US} adults taking antihypertensive medication monotherapy, versus combination therapy, has not been quantified using contemporary data. We analyzed data from 2005 to 2008, 2009 to 2012, and 2013 to 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to determine trends in monotherapy and combinations of antihypertensive medication classes among {US} adults age ≥20 years with hypertension taking antihypertensive medication (n=7837). The proportion of {US} adults taking antihypertensive medication with uncontrolled {BP} (ie, systolic {BP} ≥140 or diastolic {BP} ≥90 mm Hg) was 32.3\%, 30.2\%, and 31.0\% in 2005 to 2008, 2009 to 2012, and 2013 to 2016, respectively (Ptrend=0.37). Between 2005 to 2008 and 2013 to 2016, there was no evidence of changes in the proportions of {US} adults taking antihypertensive monotherapy (39.5\%-40.4\%, Ptrend=0.67), dual-therapy (37.9\%-38.3\%, Ptrend=0.75), triple-therapy (17.6\%-16.5\%, Ptrend=0.36), or quadruple-therapy (4.4\%-4.3\%, Ptrend=0.93).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Aim of our study was to compare adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy between newly treated patients in whom monotherapy or a 2-drug single-pill combination ({SPC}) was initially dispensed.
{METHODS}: The 63,448 residents of Lombardy Region (Italy), aged 40-80 years, who were newly treated with antihypertensive drugs during 2016, were identified and followed for 1 year after the first prescription. The outcome of interest was adherence to drug therapy that was measured according to the "proportion of days covered" ({PDC}) criterion, i.e., the ratio between the number of days in which the drug was available and the days of follow-up. Patients who had a {PDC} {\textgreater}75\% and {\textless}25\% were defined as highly and poorly adherent to drug therapy, respectively. Log-binomial regression models were fitted to compare the propensity to treatment adherence between the initial therapeutic strategies, after adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical covariates.
{RESULTS}: About 46\% and 17\% of patients showed high and poor adherence, respectively. Compared with patients under initial monotherapy (85\%), those who were initially treated with a {SPC} (15\%) had higher propensity to be highly adherent and a lower propensity to be poorly adherent to antihypertensive treatment (risk ratio: 1.18, 95\% confidence interval 1.16-1.21; 0.42, 0.39-0.45, respectively). This was the case regardless the sex, the age, the patient clinical status, and with almost any type of {SPC}.
